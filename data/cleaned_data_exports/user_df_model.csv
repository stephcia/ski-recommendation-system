53,2023-05-09,Colorado,Crested Butte Mountain,3,Really cool resort but on the small side and  most terrain is too difficult for intermediate skiers. Great town near by though,Deanna U.
54,2023-05-09,Utah,Alta,5,Really good resort for feeling like you can get lost in the mountains. Excellent terrain for all levels. Tons of snow. ,Deanna U.
55,2023-05-09,Colorado,Vail,4,One of my favorites. Good intermediate terrain and fun back bowls. less steep overall. A little fancy / kinda snobby ,Deanna U.
56,2023-05-10,Colorado,Breckenridge,4,"Breck is a decent resort, but a lot of the terrain is pretty uninteresting. Blues are very flat for example. Some of this was also due to me being with a beginner crew, and it’s a bit harder to just ski an advanced run next to a beginner run here. Also it can be crowded and is a pain to get between peaks. That being said, there’s a lot of variety for everyone, a lot of things to do in town, and lodging isn’t super expensive. Also the T Bar bar is very fun for Apres. ",Raghava K.
57,2023-05-10,Colorado,Crested Butte Mountain,5,"Really amazing and extensive terrain for advanced and expert skiers. Also great transit between town and resort, and the town has amazing food and bars. Had no idea how nice and kind of fancy of a resort Crested Butte Mountain is. Intermediates could start to exhaust their options after a couple days, but what does exist for them is great. ",Raghava K.
58,2023-05-10,Colorado,Vail,5,"I enjoyed Vail a lot more this time than my last time. I finally made it to Blue Sky Basin which really is an amazing area that one could spend a lot of time at. Also I really like the parking garage situation, despite being a little pricey there are no bad parking spots because the garage is vertical and you can get to the lifts quickly. re are some fun long frontside runs as well that have enough of an angle to have fun ripping even if they aren’t challenging. When the snow is good, there’s just a lot of terrain at Vail that’s very fun and the quantity of it means it stays good for a bit even tho the resort is still crowded. ",Raghava K.
59,2023-05-10,Colorado,Beaver Creek,3,"re are some good runs here, and part of my qualms are just being unfamiliar with the resort, but it’s easy to not know where you’re going. We found ourselves on a ton of cat tracks or very flat crossing areas. Getting around felt like a very conscious decision vs just being able to ski fun runs to the other side. Also getting parking at the main area is tough and the bus ride from the bottom parking lot, while not bad, is still not as convenient as transit as other resorts. ",Raghava K.
60,2023-05-10,Colorado,Telluride,5,"Telluride is amazing.  town has very good food and cool bars, the gondola transportation is great, and the lodging options are awesome. Staying in town vs mountain village can give two cool and different options.  scenery is the best in the US and the terrain has a lot of varied options to challenge people. Having double greens and double blues is helpful since the resort is steep and this makes it easier for intermediates to progress. And there are endless crazy lines to ski if you’re willing to hike a little. Only downsides are harder to get to and expensive. ",Raghava K.
103,2006-10-23,California,Palisades Tahoe,5,"This is one of my favorite s in Tahoe. Expansive Terrain, Great Views. Resort is best for Intermediate and Advanced Skiers.  new village provides some nice amenities. ",ericadyer
104,2006-10-23,Idaho,Sun Valley,5,"I’ve skied all over the world and everything at Sun Valley and Ketchum is first class. Great “real” town (not fake ski village) with really good restaurants and lots going on. Skiing is excellent on Baldy but it’s not a beginners’ mountain. It’s a skiers mountain with a huge vertical drop and tough terrain that is perfect for level 6 or higher skiers. Snowmaking is prevalent to make up for the historical early season lack of snow (although this year the snow was great).  Novices will better enjoy Dollar Mountain. but there isn’t much terrain diversity or vertical on Dollar. But for families there is a ton to do other than ski: tubing, ice skating, sleigh rides, snowshoeing, sledding, and a free bus service that takes you anywhere around Ketchum and Sun Valley. Bottom line: our entire experience was simply first class.

Special note on the Sun Valley Ski School   It’s on the expensive side, but worth it. Really professional and friendly staff and an excellent program for kids. Our 8 and 10 year olds LOVED their experience with Sun Valley Snow Sports at Dollar Mountain.

110,2006-10-24,Washington,Mt. Baker,5,BAker is a great  a natrual half pipe and a decent park. but baker is more about downhill and tree runs it is a great place to spend a powder day. (not my home ),jackson321
111,2006-10-24,Washington,Alpental,5,MY FAVORIT WA RESORT> althought technicly i think it is part of snoqualmie. Lots of advanced runs and the best backcountry ever. (see my summit review i say more) Plus one pass will get you accesse to three other s.,jackson321
112,2006-10-24,Washington,Stevens Pass,3,"Worst lift and ticket lines I have ever seen. Parking lot expansion has been prioritized to an extent that capacity of the entire mountain has been surpassed. On a powder dump, due to the excessive amount of parking spaces, the ticket line wraps around the building, and the lift lines extend halfway up the mountain. re are skis and snowboards littering the entire base area because the ski racks can’t keep up. Good luck finding a place to sit in any of the three lodges. New ownership prioritizes profit over all else and prices have continued to rise as overall quality of being on the mountain plummets. I have had too many bad interactions with inexperienced and rude new employees. I have been a season pass holder for many years. Never again",jackson321

116,2006-10-25,Nevada,Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe,5,Rose is one of our favorite ski areas.  Ski the new glade area (if open).  All the locals from Reno hang out here.  It reminds of what ski areas use to be like.  My kids really enjoy coming here.  I enjoy the mountain and how close it is to RENO or the Hyatt.,SammyG
117,2006-10-25,California,Mountain High,5,"Overall our experience was pretty good. Snow conditions were good given the fact that MH is a busy place and in a challenging climate area (So Cal).  lifts were a bit on the older side and my youngest wondered why many of them had no safety bars.  only lift to be problematic that I saw was the one that serviced Easy Street. Parking was as expected, busy. Get here real early on high traffic days and you'll be blessed with a parking spot at either , otherwise you'll have to park at the East to take the shuttle over to the West.  main road is a 2 lane rural road, so there will be traffic jams at the start and end of the day (8:30 4). 

 Generally the lifties were friendly and did their job, likewise with the counter help at the ticket booth, lot attendants and elsewhere. A shout out to Alyssa (sp?) at the children's learning center who exemplified customer service, helping us over an issue with some gear.

Regarding the lessons, there was some confusion with one son's full day skiing lesson and he was placed in a half day, that got sorted but he wasn't able to get any learning drills up on the lift accessed slopes which he was told that he would. My wife and other son felt that the first time lessons for snowboarding were taught at a level or so above their non experience and they could have benefited from a different teaching style. 

Traffic on the slopes was busy during our time there and I expected the usual mix of higher density boarders to a lower number of skiers with the attendant issues. I would expect this at any So Cal ski area though, it's par for the course given the region. Expect shredders and newbies mixing it up, so use situational awareness and have fun  That's why we go, right? Overall though the crowds were generally respectful of each other and I didn't witness any issues between folks that would be cause for concern.

Lodge life was typical for the level of ski area that it is, I didn't imbibe in apres ski drinks at the base (I had to drive) but the food is average park food, a bit pricey though as was the alcohol.  firepits at the west lodge looked nice and cozy.  vibe is typically chill SoCal.

Generally the place was a decent value for the money, no doubt you may find a better snow experience in different areas (CO, UT, BC etc), but as has been mentioned to the point of distraction, MH is an easily accessible place usually with decent snow. A great place to learn and do some growing before driving up to Mammoth, Tahoe, the Wasatch and beyond or maybe it's your home mountain and you're fine with that. ",SammyG
118,2006-10-25,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,5,"On March 2 thru 4, it isn't at all crowded on the mountain.  No waiting lines anywhere.  employees we encountered at Starbucks, Cheat Mountain Pizza, Foxfire Grille and  Junction were mostly unconcerned and unavailable.  We walked out of Cheat Mountain Pizza,  Junction and Foxfire because after being seated, no one came to take our order.  We tried  Junction a second time and again, no one came to take our order so we moved to the bar and were served by the Bartender.  Our room in the Rimfire Lodge had a broken toilet seat, the microwave light was out and the couch was completely worn out. We wanted a late checkout from Rimfire so we could ride snowmobiles at 6 PM so we had to pay an additional $75.  We went to lunch and came back to Rimfire only to be locked out because our keys had expired.  No one at Reservations bothered to help nor explain that one.  After calling and going thru the loop, We had to walk over to  Alpine Lodge to renew our keys.  Lady at THE DEPOT was like talking to a vacant lot.  To make a long story shorter, because there is more, Once Snowshoe has your money, GOOD LUCK with everything else.",SammyG

123,2006-10-27,Colorado,Steamboat,4,"I took my 3 and half year old boy and girl twins along with my wife from Dec. 11 till the 16. We had the best time of our life. We are from Texas, so to see that much snow was awesome. We enrolled the twins in the KVC program from 9 am till 3 pm. This was perfect for us in that we could get our skiing in while they were learning to ski.  program take sthe kids out for atleast an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon, teaching the the basics of skiing and giving them a sled ride.  kids also got to enjoy a gondola ride every day after lunch.  were both eager to go back everyday. My wife I took private lessons from Steamboat ski and  and really took our skiing to the next level. Our instructor was Larry Palmer (Level III certified) and highly recommend him. He may be a bit older, but showed me things that will stay with me a life time. I never waited in lines, had courderoy for miles, and the powder shots made heaven on earth. Everyone must eat at the top of the gondola for the lunch speacial and breathtaking view. I cant  wait to return, I love my Steamboat.",ericadyer
126,2006-10-29,Utah,Alta,5,"CLASSIC. Sorry, Boarders, you’re still not welcome.
Alta has been about pure, unspoiled skiing since 1938. If you're looking for the groomers, you're in the wrong canyon. Alta's  wide variety of terrain, breathtaking alpine scenery and superb snow conditions make an unforgettable outdoor experience for family and friends willing and able to explore off piste. Alta equals deep powder snow, rugged terrain, chutes cliffs and steep bumps. y installed the Collins highspeed quad chairlift so you'll have faster access to Rustler, Ballroom and mostly north/northwest facing terrain. when the line is too long, head to Supreme and Sugarloaf lifts for a bit then return. Don’t be intimidated by the terrain. Though intermediate skiing is limited, Albion Basin rocks for beginners  take advantage of the Ski Free After Three deal for that section of the mountain.   ",Jill Adler
127,2006-10-29,Utah,Snowbird,5,"I can't wait to ski the Bird this season.  Peruvian lift is outta here; replaced with a new high speed quad and a tunnel at the top that spits you into Mineral Basin. I hope this menas shorter tram lines and sooner openings of Mineral and the Peruvian side of this awesome mountain.  top station of the lift  will be located below the steepest Chip's Run pitch, and from there you have the option of sliding through a 600 foot tunnel on a conveyor lift to get to Mineral or heading back to the tram dock.  bonus is that if the tram ever shuts down due to wind, skiers and boarders can still access Peruvian Gulch and Mineral. You’ll be able to predict the storm track more accurately with snowbird's new online snowcam (www.snowbird.com/snowcam).  snowcam provides live shots of the current storm's snow accumulation.  whole scene is lit so you'll be able to see the snow falling at any time of the day or night.

128,2006-10-29,Utah,Snowbasin,4,"Once secret Snowbasin is only 40 miles from Salt Lake City International Airport and word's getting out! Nearby Ogden has attracted more than seven major ski manufacturers (including atomic and Salomon) to relocate and skiers are now making the drive to experience the 2,959 vertical feet of bowls, chutes and groomers covering more than 2,800 acres. Earl Holding’s (owner of Sun Valley Resort, Sinclair Oil and Little America Hotels) Snowbasin is truly a gem. What was once a small local hill is a full blown rider's paradise. A victim to warmer temperatures, Snowbasin's powder is often 'heavier' than over in the Cottonwood Canyons but it's still more plentiful and lighter than just about anywhere outside of Utah. 
Avoid the Strawberry area on foggy days; instead, play in the trees under the John Paul lift. This  is so much more than ""that place that hosted the 2002 Olympic Downhill"". and don't get me started on the food.  stirfry rocks!",Jill Adler
129,2006-10-29,Utah,Brighton,3,"Brighton is consistently voted number one for ""Best Value"" and ""Best Child/Family Friendly Terrain,” and though some  ratings are biased, in this case, they're on the money. Brighton can’t help but attract the kiddies  especially the ones on snowboards. Now that Alta has replaced Germania and Watson Shelter with state of the art construction, Brighton becomes the #2 old school  behind Powder Mountain. Heads up   Millicent lift is destined for the scrap pile after this season. A new high speed lift is planned for the area, making your access to the backcountry that much smoother.

133,2006-10-29,Wyoming,Jackson Hole,5,"Jackson EpilogI went to Jackson Hole to ski the steeps.  I have no interest in the ""forgiving greens"" or the ""wide open cruisers"".  Corduroy belongs on pants.  I don't know if these even exist at Jackson Hole, nor do I care.  I went to ski the steeps.  and Jackson delivered.For seven days I completely immersed myself in skiing, expert skiing.  No women and children whining about how cold it is or lost gear or equipment problems.  My compatriots and I went to Jackson to ski, to ski a lot, to ski hard, to ski the steeps. terrain at Jackson Hole is unique.  Viewed from a distance, only a few ski runs are visible because the trees are generally few and well spaced.  Did I mention the terrain is steep?   ski area shares a boarder with Grand Teton National Park, one of the most beautiful and spectacular places in the country.  Glaciers sliced down the sides of these mountains creating horns, arˆtes, hanging valleys and cliffs like exist nowhere else in American skiing.As every serious skier knows by now, the iconic Jackson Hole tram is headed for the last roundup.  This is its last ski season and we went on holy mission, a Hajj, to pay our last respects to one of the greatest lifts this country has ever seen.  Vertical rise: 4,139 feet.  Ride time: 12 minutes.  Terrain accessed: unsurpassed.  Management says the tram could still operate for several more years, but to be on the safe side, it will glide up the mountain for the last time in September 2006.  Management also says it doesn't have the money to replace the tram and is looking for alternative funding sources including the Wyoming state government.   governor and the legislature have already said, ""Fuggedaboutit"".  So what will Jackson Hole look like without the tram?  Still steep.  After the tram goes, the highest lift will be the Sublette chair, but it ends about 700 vertical feet below tram's summit.  In the immediate future, Rendezvous Bowl, the primary run from the top will be hike to terrain.  So will Corbet's Couloir, one of the most infamous runs in the country.   quasi out of bounds skiing in Cody Bowl will also be a bit more of a hike. Sublette Chair will be one of the primary Jackson attractions in the post tram era for steeps.  From the top, you can access Cheyenne Bowl, Bernie's Bowl, Laramie Bowl, Tensleep Bowl and the Cirque.   hike up the Headwall is also accessed most easily from here.  For those tempting out of bounds fate, Rock Springs Bowl and Green River Bowl are just beyond the southern boundary.  If that's not enough, the Hobacks, Lower Sublette Ridge, South Coulter Ridge and other expert runs dropping to the bottom of the mountain are also available.  Session the north facing Alta Chutes a few times.  Throw in a few runs down Bivouac and Bivouac Woods, also north facing, but one bowl south of the Alta Chutes.  Traverse over and drop into the Expert Chutes under some spectacular cliffs, cut over to Paintbrush, then hit the Thunder Chair, the other lift accessing the killer terrain under the old tram. Thunder Chair, like Sublette, ends on a ridge and you can ski either side.   signature run from Thunder is the Tower Three Chute.  Steep.  Relentless.  Sweet.  This is another north facing run and this whole exposure has some of the thickest trees on the mountain.  Several other runs and glades drop down this same exposure.  Cliff bands snake through some of this terrain, but they are fairly well marked. hike up the Headwall accesses not only its namesake, but also Casper Bowl, Sheridan Bowl, the Crags and numerous chutes through and between the named bowls.   required hike cuts down on the ski traffic, of course, and as a result, some of the best snow on the mountain is available in these areas. biggest lift, after the tram is put out to pasture, will be the Bridger Gondola which rises 2730 vertical feet and accesses some fun trees and provides the way to get to the Thunder Chair.   AprŠs Vous high speed quad has some blues under it, but it also drops you at the top of the Saratoga Bowl which can be a major kick on a powder day, as we found out.  se runs aren't as steep as those from Sublette or Thunder, but there are some great trees and interesting rocks for jumping and dodging.Lodging was in a generic condo in Teton Village at the ski area base.  AprŠs ski was at the Mangy Moose for beer and loud music.   town of Jackson, 8 miles or so away, has the best restaurants, especially for steaks and game meat.  Beer is sold at liquor store in the same building as the Moose.Around town we saw several other groups of guys like ours that were there for the serious skiing.   aprŠs ski hot tubs were filled with guys discussing top of the line skis in detail or telling tales of past trips to Alta, Snowbird, Squaw Valley, Taos, Aspen Highlands, Telluride and other holy places of the steep and deep.  Nary a word was uttered of day care, lessons or shopping.   tram line, which ran 20 to 45 minutes, was filled with similar chatter.  Total immersion in skiing, expert skiing.

I do not ski, so when I bring my grandson up, he's alone.. since when do you tell single riders that they have to have a partner to ride the lifts?????? When he came back to the car , very upset and told me what the guy at the lift said to him, I stood at my car and within 5 minutes watched more then 15 people singly get on the Panorama lift, that's not even counting the other lift where there was too many to count. If that's the case your guide should be asking everyone to pair up to ride. You should be ashamed that you have people working there that will single out young riders and make them feel bad and upset them. I just dont understand how that is allowed....",Twenz

Squaw has got the terrain and skiers to walk (ski) the talk.  I'm just getting to know Squaw and it's going to be a long term relationship.   When I first get there, I follow the duct taped shredders over to Shirley to pick up any fresh lines and/or missed stashes.  n, work toward Siberia to see how the Palasades have set from the evening chill.  Next, Headwall to get some nice big carvey turns down the shoulders.   Lastly, KT 22/Olympic to play in the alternate chutes and bowls.  I've played a little in the trees of Squaw Creek, but have mostly left it to the boarders.  y deserve a special place like anyone.  You can get alot of skiing in on this hill.  It spreads the crowds out and gives you something to really step up your game.  Great breakfast/lunch joints at the base, but the  also has it's share of high school cafeteria style eating (for the quick take on the chair bite).   Nice bar life afterwards with a energetic crowd.   new village adds some class with retail like the Wine/Cigar store.  But at present if I want a good meal I'll go to Tahoe City.

When the Upper Gate is open, you might hesitate from the 50 degree faces and un ending chutes for that 2k run with a icy trail return.  Hey, I understand.  You gotta start somewhere, right?  Spend a couple years over Crystal/Stevens and you might be ready for it.  Get some Avy training.  Get comfortable staying on your feet on tricky terrain.  n, follow someone you you trust who knows their way around the slopes.  You don't go to Alpental to cruise the groomers.  You go to scare yourself on the off piste and come home feeling like a warrior (after a few pints in the bar afterwards of course).  A warning to the first timers though.  If you're not up to it, you'll come home feeling like a poser.  This hill has a tight local following.  If you show you're talent on the hill, they'll greet you as one of their own in the bar.  If you don't, you'll feel like a goldfish in a bowl.  Alpental is where you go to ski some of the sickest chair assessible terrain in the Northwest.  If you step up to it, you'll keep coming back.

Use to be the Milky Way to Stagecoast run was the talk of the West.  Now I go to Heavenly for the novelty, but not terrain and mountain experience.  I actually get frustrated when I ski there now. It's a difficult hill to move around on.   chairs don't flow well together, so you spent alot of time go to/fro places.   best technical skiing is in Killebrew/Mott Canyon, but it's not alot of vert and the chairs over there seem even slow for a attached double.  I'm all for the charm of a slow double, but these don't really do it for me.  If you roam around some you find some ok groomers, but you'll also find alot of crowds.  It's a pretty popular  and you'll get your share of international experience on the chairs talking with lots of foreigners.  I'd give Gunbarrel a thumbs up though.  If you'd like to test your skills, try hanging with Glen Plake on the annual Gunbarrel challenge.  1.7K of volkwagon moguls for 50 runs in the 1 day.  That could be interesting.   service and food is so so.  It's no Deer Valley.   Now, if you're hanging in the Casinos and need somewhere to take the edge off the hang over, than by all means jump on the Gondola.  Otherwise, I'll point my headlights toward Kirkwood, Squak, Alpine, ... In fairness, they have some pretty good bands at the CA base.

Ever since, we have been skiing there each spring yearly for over a decade.  In 2019 we were unable to have our family ski trip due to the closing Sugarbush during the Pandemic.  We purchased three Quad Passes to prepare for our annual trip.  Sugarbush has only extended the use of these passes a few weeks into the 2020 2021 ski season, to be used prior to 12/24/20.  It is not feasible for our family of 5 to plan a trip on such short notice.  After several e mails with the manager, Rob, we were informed that they will NOT extend the use of the passes for the entire 2020 2021 ski season.  We can certainly use these passes prior to May 2021.  Based on the lack of the use through out the entire season, my family will be losing over $1000.  Sugarbush did not offer any refund ( full or partial), or no consideration for use past December 24.  We are extremely disappointed in the lack of understanding, deficiency in flexibility and greedy behavior exhibited by this multimillion dollar .  
We use to rave about this family friendly facility, now we will certainly let others know about the how cheep and narrow minded the management is.

Break has great terrain for all skill levels, the lower areas just get over crowded during the days and the weekends.  commute to Breck from Denver on Friday afternoon and Sunday evening is horrible. Make sure to come during the week and you will have the place to yourself.

I rode here the week before the Imperial Express opened but I can imagine that it is changing the way Breck rides. 

 parks at Breck are excellent and expect to see X gamers and Olympic medalists hucking big airs in the pipes and parks. and if you see Hanna Beaman give her my number.

First time there and i'm going again this coming season , hopefully the snow will be as good  , it couldn't be better. re is something for everyone and once at the top you can get away from the crowds no problem , the area is so huge . If you've never experienced deep powder then get in amongst the trees , you'll soon find what you've been missing . Night life is what you'd expect from an american  , it's not all that but obviously if you're with the right crowd you can have a blast anywhere .

Nevertheless there were little to no lines at the lifts, everything worked well. Nearly all the lifts are detachable high speed quads. y are designed to connect well so little poleing to do. terrain is varied   with 50% groomed each day but plenty of moguls and steep for the more advanced skiers. at least enough for a week or so anyway. y have a large beginner area at the top of the mountain but off to one side so slower and clumsier skiers are kept out of the way of those who know what they are doing and want to do it at speed. It's a beautiful place and I loved it. Highly suitable for families.Ski school  is fiercely expensive and was a bit shambolic. Class sizes of 8 and different teachers on 5 consecutive days did seem a bit hard on my kids (ages 5 and 7).Overall it is very expensive but you do feel that you get treated royally and are getting something extra for your money.Highly recommended for the well healed, particularly for families.",RippinSkiers

2 years ago I took a little trip to Summit County with 8 friends. 1 girl broke her wrist and another broke her arm within 2 minutes of each other on seperate runs. Ski patrol was organized and responded with excellence.  staff at the clinic was helpful and treated us well.

289,2006-11-27,Minnesota,Wild Mountain Ski,3,I skied here growing up for 10+ years and loved it! I was so excited to bring my own kid here to learn to ski. I signed him up for a one hour lesson so I could go ski some black diamonds without him. Well despite doing my best to communicate again and again with their ski school department it was just a horrible experience. I was told the instructor would be out on the hill soon. After 10 minutes I went back in to check and they said oh they are running late. Ok fine whatever. Lesson finally started 25 minutes late. My son has skied before so I wanted them to get up on the chairlift and do a longer run. I also asked about pickup time and said “so the lesson is an hour right?”  instructor was like well no because I have another class at the top of the hour. Whatever I’ve already wasted too much time so I went and skied three hills and came back and got him. No one was at the ski school desk and the other employees couldn’t help me onsite. I wanted a refund or another lesson at least. So I emailed when I got home and they never responded. y just clearly don’t care. ,filterban

I have skiied Austria, Italy, Mammoth Ca, Cranmore and Sugar Mountain NH and then discovered Winter Park!! It is sooooooooooooo great   the variety of runs   groomed ungroomed and off piste are so varied that it meets almost anyone's needs. Every time I have been there over the past 3 years we have had new powder for about 50% of  the time which makes for great variety   even on the groomed slopes.  terrain park is great with some interesting jumps and rails   my son just can't get enough BUT the best kept secret is the Parsen Bowl and the back bowls for the advanced skiers. We just can't get enough   the tiny 2 seater lift makes it slow getting to the top.  new lifts hopefully will make this easier to reach   but lets hope not too crowded.

As for the village itself   it has nice resturants, not too expensive, and just outside of town is the tubing park  great for the young (and old 60+) kids to have a ball.

 only downside to Winter Park is its lack of Apres Ski   something most US ski venues need to do something about. Europe is the best in this category   those Continentals know how to Party!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

293,2006-11-27,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,4,"A Basin offers some of the steepest terrain in Colorado.  This is a true ""locals"" hangout.  When the mountain is fully open, there is such diversity of runs.  You can find the easy groomer (not many of them), the bumped up Pali runs, cornice ally, and then the amazing East Wall.   East Wall offers extreme skiing at the top and expert skiing in the middle.  re is a high concentration of telemark skiing at this mountain.  This is not a , this is a SKI MOUNTAIN!  Sure, there is a bar, and a cafeteria, but there is no lodging unless you camp out overnight in your vehicle.  

As for the lifestyle at A Basin, the ""lot"" is like no other mountain I've ever been too.  It reminds me of a tail gating party before a football game.  It's just pure fun!  Everyone is always very relaxed and easy going.

March 17,2020 using our free reciprocal passes that come with our Brundage season passes.  people at the ticket office were very rude to us and our friends. First our friends, also from McCall, had called ahead to make sure their new 20 21 pass would be okay because Brundage had taken their 19 20 passes when they issued the new ones. No one at Lookout knew anything about their call and would not honor their word. n they went on to tell us Brundage was closed so they wouldn't give us our tickets. Brundage hadn't closed yet, but they only looked at the headline. We had no web service so couldn't check. Brundage closed at the end of the day. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed and surprised at how rude, unfriendly and unreasonable the Lookout Pass employees/ticket office were.",jay
324,2006-11-30,New Mexico,Taos Ski Valley,5,"Taos is absolutely the best. It effortlessly combines very polite and courteous service, an excellent ski school including group and private lessons, and is an intriguing mix of European charm and Southwest flavor. It is enchanting for a true skier.  I learned how to ski there when I was a child in their famous Kinderkafig Ski School.  instructors were brilliant at teaching me the ""pizza slice and French fry"" positions, the service was tremendous for my parents, who were able to ski to their hearts content knowing I was in a good place having fun and learning solid skiing techniques. As an adult, I continue to return there year after year because it is classic. It is one of the few ski areas still in private hands  owned fully by the Blake family and they are obviously committed to retaining its integrity. I think my favorite thing about this enchanting area is their passion and dedication to skiing. To them, it is not about the fashion plates or movie stars (though the come too!); it is all about the skiing.  focus is on how to make you a better skier—to challenge and improve your skiing, which my family thoroughly enjoys. Taos is far from pretentious Vail, or trendy Tahoe.  and I really appreciate not having to share the slopes with snow boarders!! It attracts me to Taos rather than deters me.  If I am going to lay down the kind of money a ski ticket costs these days, then I want to be impressed with the skiing and Taos DELIVERS.   snow is as dry and crisp as any you'll find in the Rockies, the terrain is more challenging than most places and the people could not be more friendly or passionate about skiing.

327,2006-11-30,North Carolina,Sugar Mountain,2,"For those of us living in the sunny southeast, Sugar Mountain is a blessing. 1200 vertical may not seem huge by any Rocky Mountain standard but this is the part of the country where we can play golf in the morning then drive three hours and ski that same night. Sugar is a great place to get the legs warmed up as my ski buddies and I anticipate our annual pilgramage to one of the Colorado/Utah/Montana ski s in the Rockies.

With skiing in the south timing is everything. If you can catch a winter storm and not get stuck behind some southerners who are clueless on how to drive in the snow, then Sugar is a great destination. ",stevenstclair
360,2006-12-05,Colorado,Monarch Mountain,4,"I have skied Monarch the last five years.  Prior experiences include most Colorado s, Deer Valley in Utah, and extensive time at Zermatt and Davos in Switzerland.

Monarch is a mid sized place, not small but not nearly an Aspen or Vail.  All runs end up at the same base location, so most unlikely that family members would get lost.  Lodge is ok, bar is cosy.  

Nice mix of intermediate and advanced runs, with recent upgrade to beginners area.  Good little kids area.  Some runs are consistently groomed, others not (on purpose), or only one side of a run, etc.  I think run maintenance is very good.

Lift tickets are a real bargain, with lots of deals available through motels in Salida (15 miles to east on Hwy 50).  Also Monarch Lodge, about 5 miles east of Monarch, probably the top place.  Buy your tickets in a package with lodging to get best deal.

Equipment rental at Monarch is very reasonable with good quality equipment, including demos.  Also towards Salida are three good ski shops.  $14 or so per day will get you nicely equipped. 

Everyone at Monarch is friendly and helpful   and I mean everyone.  Cafeteria workers, lift operators, instructors, clerical, etc, etc.  

Oh, and the snow   lots of it.  All natural.  Some 30ft or so during the season.  Typical base by mid december is about 4ft.   When Monarch closes in early April it is not unusual for base to still be 6ft or more.  Due to high altitude on continental divide (base is about 10,600ft), the snow is consistently dry.  Great powder.  

If you hate lift lines, go to Monarch.  Most times during week absolutely NO ONE in a line, ever.  On regular weekends, you might have a couple of people.   worst might be the bottom lift right after lunch where there might be a couple of minute wait, but that is unusual.  Even during Christmas and spring break the lines are quite modest, with the worst being in the beginner area and bottom lift.  Stay away from those two lifts and you won't have much of a wait.  and that's the worst it gets.  Some days I wish more people were on the slopes, so Monarch would make more money !!!

As you can tell, I highly recommend Monarch, especially for families.  Modest prices, no crowds, friendly people, good snow, reasonably large ski area.   Enjoy.",Dan Gibson
363,2006-12-06,Washington,Crystal Mountain Washington,4,"Just a quick report to let everyone know that Crystal is where the pow is right now.  Any descent is rocking right now.  y're open/closing chair 6 w/o notice, so don't waste your time waiting on this.  Plenty of freshies between 'Bull Run' and 'Exterminator'.  If you really want to open the throttle, rip 'Right Angle'.  You won't be dissapointed.  As the temps drop some, the moisture will continue to be pulled out of the existing layers to create chalky results.  Watch for avy flows right now on untouched steeps.   My guess, they'll hold on the far backcountry gates for at least a week until the temps come up some.  That's ok as there are plenty of descents in bounds and that just leave more depth when it does open.  Don't miss the best pre season ever at Crystal right now.",anhillx

Got the intel that the 1 day was epic from the guy (Don) who opened Nash with waste deep turns.   slopes are holding well, with expected hardpack conditions throughout.  It's pretty much what you make of it up there.   fog is donuting the mid, so top is blue jay and bottom is gray.  Loss of visability sneaks up on you after slicing up the chaulky tops.  It's alot of fun on a loose mid fat that absorbs the un even terrain.  You'll get alot of edge hits if you muscle things, so keep it light and flow with the bumps.   snow triggers (softens up) around noon, so get there in the early afternoon and close the upper chair.  You can get a couple good loops in within 2 hours to crank up the vertical.  Didn't venture into BK, but figure it's holding some hidden stashes.  I don't believe the gates have opened, so only the renegades have tasted the forbidden fruit.   Noticed a new firepit outside the lodge, so the beers should taste even better this season.

404,2006-12-13,Indiana,Paoli Peaks,2,"Paoli is the first place I ever went snowboarding. That is where I got my first lesson, and started to get the hang of snowboarding. Also it was a place I went to almost every year I was in high school with a certain group of friends. So I have to say Paoli is kind a traditional place for me and my friends. It has a lot of sentimental value.

Anyhow, the snow is pretty much 100% man made. Im pretty sure they barely even opened last year due to the fact that the weather didn't get good enough to make any snow. But thats ok because the hotel we usually stay at which is French Lick Springs, in French Lick, was shut down due to the fact of remodeling and putting in a casino. But there is a good chance we will be going back this year.

I think there is like somewhere like 3   5 lifts, and maybe like 8 14 runs at the most. If you have a chance to go to Colorado, or Utah, go there. But this place is cool to go to on a weekend for a short vacation.

 only problem I ever had with the place was that sometimes it can get very icey, especially at night. Also one trip there, there was actually bald spots in the snow where there was patches of grass. I had a friend hit one and go flying into mud. It was not cool.

Not rude but the people are just quiet and not in a hurry.  Sometimes the lift lines on sunrise mountain can get out of control because of this.  

But the mountain is great when they have snow.  Not many people venture over to Cyclone and Apache so it's usually less crowded.  (Sometimes it's better to park at this base to avoid the lines when leaving) 

 terrain park is hit or miss.   y have some O K jumps if you catch them early and some seedy rails.  Every once in a while they will attempt to make a half pipe but the lip is really choppy.  It's fun to play around in this park, but don't expect anything serious

436,2006-12-18,West Virginia,Canaan Valley,4,"This is where I learned how to ski about ten years ago in the college years and have been back about 4 times since then.  Always have had a blast even though I have become better through the years and have to make a 500 mi drive from the midwest.  re arent any super difficult trails, so I cant recommend this to anyone who is used to the rockies or is very proficient, but for a moderate to above avg skiier who doesnt want to spend a ton of $$, this place is great.  Great place to learn for sure.  I dont do terrain parks, so cant help you there.  Very quaint and it's fun to rest at the lodge at the base for a few drinks with your friends.  I seem to always catch the snowstorms there.  re are a decent amount of families, but not as annoying as at Snowshoe.  If you're skiing two days, I would use this as a warmup  before heading over to Timberline which has more challenging runs.  Night skiing is so much fun here because evey time I've been, the slopes were empty after dark and no lift lines, with wide open runs to see how fast you really can go.

460,2006-12-20,Colorado,Beaver Creek,5,"Here is a quick summary of Beaver Creek      luxury (expensive), often groomed, family friendly, excellent for beginners, Disney esque faux Alpine village.  If you had bought a condo years ago when our family started going to BC, you would be quite pleased with its price now.

BC is an ""Upside Down"" hill, meaning there are several good green (beginner) runs at the top.  This makes life MUCH easier for beginners; lower slopes typically warm during the day and get a bit slushy, freezing at night.   grooming helps moderate this problem, but such snow conditions make learning considerably harder.  Beginners progress fast at BC. As some reviewers mentioned the Sleigh Ride to Beano's Cabin (expensive but good dinners) is quite popular, especially for children age 3 to 10, even some teens (always hard to guess, that).",Mark Rosasco

You gotta get thru the ice bumped hourglass in the middle, but before/after you can really get some nice grooves going.  Nash was pretty beat up and crusted over.   bowl throats were hacked/set and shoulders choppy/crusted.  Not for the weak at heart, but doable if you can stay in the middle of your skis with hard edge engagement.  Worth bragging rights.  Honestly didn't check the gates as the inbounds told the story of rough conditions.  Nice light crowds, good bacon cheese burgers, and easy going liftees.

528,2006-12-30,Washington,Crystal Mountain Washington,2,"Got a couple hours on the hill today to check it out.  It's getting closer to prime time ski season as weekend wear is showing itself.  Groomers are very nice.  Great edge control, hero carving conditions.  Off Piste has crusted up, so needs to get either colder (to draw the moisture out) or get choped up by skiers to get some nice brushing turny conditions.  I wouldn't want to see it get warmer and it'll crust up bad overnight.  Checked both BKs.  Southback off King is crusted over 3 6 inches of slab.  Makes for pretty dicey turns down the chutes.  Braindamaged was a bust as top and bottom are both crusted/cruded out.  Queen a little better at the top, but ends to soon as the last half is beat up/crudded out.  Powder bowl is also nice on top, but chunky on last 200 yards.  Chair runs under REX and GV are so so.  GV's best, but short.  Pro course probably has the best conditions/slope around.  Take it over to Exterminator to burn the legs.  Finish on Bullrun to hold the speed down.  I'd loop this a couple times to really stretch it out.  Northback's still got a couple stashes, you just have to enjoy the I 5 return which is cut up/iced.  My money's on Teddy as it's still untouched on the open faces.  With no new snow forecast for a week, I'd spend the day hiking behind King to mark up the back bowls.  Great exercise and fun to see your turns in the snow.  In the morning, take advantage of the groomers off REX down to base.  Forest will get the crowd, so hit that around lunch time when folks are chowing.  Otherwise, I'd nip away at Northback trying out the chutes off Right/Left Angle.  ",anhillx

It is a beginner & intermediate oriented  within easy driving distance of downtown Santa Fe.  It can get crowded during holidays but for the most part you can ski straight on to the lifts if you stay away from the base & pick the right time of year.  When the snow is good, the only thing to watch out for is that the top of Lift 3 tends to get a little wind blown & icy at the top of Roadrunner.  

Santa Fe is a great apre ski town so long as you aren't looking to go clubbing.   restaurant scene is great & there's absolutely nothing like red chile burritos or enchiladas and a margarita after a good of skiing.  You might also want to check out 10,00 Waves japanese spa on the ski road for some R&R afterwards.  Definitely worth it!

 hardcore skiers will want to go to Taos but boarders need to go into CO as Taos is skiers only.  SW Co offers some good choices within 4 hrs drive of ABQ, especially Wolf Creek & Durango.  A little longer drive (don't take Red Mountain pass in the winter!) will get you to Telluride as well.",Dan Gibson

 runs are just insane... from easier to harder ones. Vail has something for everyone. nothing gets close to it. We have been to almost every  in the USA and nothing gets close to vail in terms of the total package! 

I take a ski guide for the first 2 days I am there that takes me to parts of the mountain others usually dont get to and also to improve my snow board skills. If you decide to use a guide ask to ride with Ray Sforzo!  guy is fun and a shred master! 100% fun guaranteed!!!",RippinSkiers
712,2007-01-11,California,Mammoth Mountain,4,"Mammoth is a great  to visit, it is very large so there is plenty of areas to check out on the mountain. tree runs and terrain are really good, they also have something for everyone. It can get crowded especially down at the lodges and the prices are a little steep $71 but I mean that is what it is like at alot of the s in Colorado. To avoid some of the crowds stick the mid mountain lifts and the back sides less people go there. Mammoth is located between Los Angeles, CA about 4 6hr and Reno, NV 3 4hr away on HWY 395. Now I do have a season pass here but I would not say it is my favorite , that would be KIRKWOOD. Best time to go is during the week there are no lines and the price is much cheaper. If you do go make sure you are prepared Mammoth can get a lot of snow last new years 2005/2006 it snowed 8FT in one night and they hand to close down the HWY 395 but there is no really mountainess driving slow straight climb on 395 also make sure well you are there to check out the Hotsprings they are really dope.

719,2007-01-11,Utah,Alta,5,"This past week I had the privilege of skiing Alta.  Alta has always been revered and feared by me as the place of a skier's dream: challenging terrain, a hardcore environment, and tons of snow.  Well, Alta is exactly that, and a whole lot more.

When you arrive at Alta, you really feel the old school ski town vibe.   place radiates an old style ski village aura in the architecture and layout.  When you walk up to get your lift ticket, the cashiers aren't wearing flashy, embroidered logo $200 vests with their hair all primped.  Instead, they are fresh off the slopes  probably hitting a few pre chair turns  with helmet hair, still in their snow pants.   other people standing in line aren't your average gapers or seasonal skiers.  Everyone there is there for a reason: to ski some of the best terrain on the continent and this is their life.  se two elements—plus the lack of snowboarders—really ups the great atmosphere that Alta gives off.

But with hardcore locals and hard ripping transient skiers, Alta has another side—one that threatens people with fair to average skiing skill sets.  Every where you look, you will see incredible skiers with incredible skis.  re aren’t too many skinny sticks around.  We were 3 4 days away from our last powder day, and people were still skiing commonly reserved for deep powder.  I was threatened by this, but quickly found out that even 3 4 days after a powder day, there’s still plenty of powder (or packed powder) runs to really make use of a fat ski.

Alta has some of the sickest terrain I have ever been on.  re’s so much “inbound backcountry” that someone arriving to ski powdery groomers will surely be frightened.  at the top of the Collins lift, for example, a large, expansive bowl was filled with snow waiting to be poached.  While there were definitely tracks, most of the snow along the far sides of the traverse was there for the taking.

If you do want to ride on wide, expansive, soft groomers, then Alta has that too, although it’s mostly known for its varied expert terrain.   groomers are windy and fun, and always rewarding.

We skied Alta on a Monday and found the lift lines non existent.   busiest lift—that services the main parking lot area—the Collins lift—is the newest (“Alta’s big jump into the 21 century,” one local told us) high speed detachable that has a midway loading point (perfect for lapping the Ballroom area).  We also used the Sugarloaf and Supreme lifts, which also had minimal lines.  Alta’s lifties are great for keeping control of the lift lines when they do grow.

Between the atmosphere, terrain, and great snow (Alta is rumored to get much more inches of snow than neighboring Snowbird), Alta has everything a skier can want.  You’ll never have to worry about an icy patch on a groomer or cat track either, since snowboarders aren’t allowed.  Afterward, we hit the Alta Ski Shop for a few souvenirs and conversed with some of the locals about how great Alta was.  Alta pushed my limits and expanded my skiing horizons, making it <i>my favorite</i> ski .",Richard 1
720,2007-01-11,Utah,Snowbird,5,"It seems as if Utah doesn’t have any s that aren’t world reknowned.  Snowbird is another terrific , nestled in the beautiful canyons of the Wasatch Range, mere minutes from the hustle and bustle of Salt Lake City.  True to its reputation, Snowbird boasts some of the greatest skiing you’ll ever take part in.

Snowbird contrasts differently from its neighboring (and linked) , Alta, because Snowbird has something for everyone: terrific grooming, a terrain park, and steep and expert terrain.  Snowbird has an inviting atmosphere—relaxed and friendly, as well.  It’s the big, warm fuzzy in Little Cottonwood Canyon.  If you need a family ski , this is the place.

During the week, Snowbird is your own place.  Although the parking lot may appear to be crammed, you’ll barely spend too much time in the lift or tram lines.  If the tram line is busy, however, you can jump on the much needed Peruvian Express chair (which replaces an old, antiquated, always busy two seater) and get into some great all around terrain.  Treat yourself to a trip through the revolutionary Peruvian Tunnel, even if you don’t want access to the other side (Mineral Basin is a lot of expert terrain, but there is a cat track to get beginners or the intimidated down safely), just to say you’ve been through the only ski tunnel in North America.

Last year, I was treated to a pounding snow storm that filled up Snowbird with 10” of fresh snow while I was there.  This year contrasted quite differently: a lot of hazards were exposed due to the low snow fall, and what snow did cover areas with many rocks and stumps (mineral basin, Baldy), had hard, icy snow.  Groomers were iced over as well, while only the runs that were exposed to the sun immediately in the morning were soft.  We spent most of our time in Mineral Basin, skiing corned snow that was soft and ran through some technical runs that got your legs and heart working.  Later, we chased the sun into the Peruvian Gulch area and just under the Baldy traverse for some more great snow (comparatively) and technical runs.

One problem with Snowbird is the price…spendy!  Granted, you get tons of terrain for your price, but the tickets some of the highest priced in the Cottonwood canyons.  Additionally, bring a sack lunch when you go, because food is expensive (especially mid mountain, where a slice of pizza runs you $9).

Snowbird is also a very cautious , which someone of my skill really appreciates.  While I can handle most of what is thrown at me terrain wise, I can’t anticipate terrain as well as most people, so I usually have a friend who skis ahead of me and scouts a line first.  Compared to many other s, Snowbird recognizes how easily someone can access terrain that may be beyond their skill, and marks them appropriately (ropes and hazards of the tram and in the receding area help you navigate anything sketchy).  However, once you get closer to the base area, the runs become muddled and trail markings get poorer (Chip’s Run, Chip’s Bypass Run, Lower Chip’s Run…enough with the Chip’s!).  Myself and two other friends scouted a path down on the trail map to just go as fast as we could (we were timing ourselves), and we all ended up in a hardened mogul field because we missed the trail markings.

To get the very best bang for your buck, jump immediately on the tram.  No matter what your skiing ability is, there’s a way for you to get down safely, but you have to experience the thrill of the tram going up, and relish the view from the top of Snowbird.  On a clear day (like yesterday), you can see all the way down into Salt Lake City.  It’s really quite incredible.

Advanced and Expert skiers will highly enjoy Snowbird.  Snowbird doesn’t have as much expert terrain as neighboring Alta, but that’s not to say that the expert terrain that they <i>do</i> have isn’t challenging.  A hike up Baldy will ensure that non believers in the challenge of the terrain are silenced.  and if you want fast and steep, check the Cirque—a breath taking snowfield visible from the terrain.  Skiers look like dots among the massive face.  Go scary fast here without fear of any hazards.

Snowbird is truly a great , and I’m glad to have skied it both on gnarly days with no snow, and days where it was pounding snow.  On a good snow day, Snowbird literally doubles in size, making everything within the ropes ski able.  No matter what your needs, Snowbird has it: if you want a terrific, expansive family , or if you want challenging, easy to access terrain.  Just don’t get any pizza…",Richard 1
729,2007-01-12,Utah,Brighton,4,"Brighton has been a staple for our ski trips to Utah since we started going (OK, so only a year ago), but it's such a great place, that we go there at least twice a trip.  This year, we kicked off our Utah ski trip with Brighton, and we were rewarded with 6"" of fresh while we were there.  On top of that, it had just dumped on the Wasatch range the day before, so we were killing fresh most of the day.

Brighton's a ""small""  compared to everything else in the Wasatch range: Alta and Snowbird have larger and more epic terrain, and Park City and the Canyons are spread out more.  But Brighton  the little  that could  has a secret.  Terrific snow conditions, breathtaking views, fantastic backcountry, and epic tree skiing.

To go to Brighton is to find exactly what you are looking for: want tree skiing?  Brighton has the best in the Cottonwood canyons.  You can take any lift and drop in between two blue runs for moderate sloped trees, or cat over to a double black for steep, tight tree runs.  My favorite area is skier's right off of the Snake Creek Express chair, between the steady rolling blue runs.  I also enjoy heading down skier's left of the cat track from Great Western and dropping just below the cat, running directly under the Great Western chair.  This is some of the best tree skiing I have ever done.  Even on windy days (such as our first day at Brighton, when 70+ MPH winds closed Great Western), we were able to take shelter in the trees and find pow that hadn't been swept away.  Even when we returned days later, we found tracks through most of our previous tree runs, but with a little effort were able to find freshies again.

I haven't taken part in much of Brighton's backcountry (the gate off of the Great Western lift, I was told by a local, has some pretty burly terrain, and I doubted that I could keep up with my friends), so we opted instead to ski some of the ""inbounds backcountry"" off the Millicent lift.   Millicent lift is far skier's left (or directly to the right of the  when looking up from the parking lot) and is a scary fixed double that takes you high up off the ground  not for the faint hearted.  When we arrived at the top, we found the two gates closed for the backcountry due to avalanche danger.  Most of the front side off of the Millicent lift was gnared up with rocks and logs due to low snow conditions, but we were able to ski some small chutes and drop a few small cliffs, landing usually shin  or knee deep in fresh snow.  Another favorite spot for me is about 1/3 of the way down the cat track off of the Great Western lift.  Drop into the double black there with a seemingly gnarly line with tons of rocks, stumps, and brush.  Clear the top half of the glade and be treated to a wide, steep, expanse with fresh snow for the taking.

We barely spent any time in the middle of the , where fun groomers await those not ready for tree or backcountry skiing.   groomers are wide, soft, and very easy to handle for beginner to intermediate skiers.  I was amazed at the amount of newbies taking skiing lessons at Brighton.  It seems as if the front side slopes here are conducive to learning, so that may explain the huge throngs of people with ski instructors.   real gem, for sure, in the middle of the  (by ""middle,"" I mean the two base chairs,) is the park at Brighton.  During our second visit this trip (on a Tuesday), we saw some amazing snowboarders and skiers pulling tricks in the park.  I saw a snowboarder so flawlessly stomp a rightside 9 that I thought he was pro.  and then I watched 4 double plankers pull truck drivers in machine gun succession in the half pipe, followed by a girl on twin tips who popped 360s out of the pipe like I pop aspirin after a day of skiing.  Before I knew it, the chair was at the top, and I left wanting to take the same chair again to watch the local park scene go off some more.

Moving off the slopes, Brighton is a completely unobtrusive .  re’s not too much merchandising going on (ala Snowbird), prices for food and drinks are moderate, and there’s no mid mountain restaurants waiting to fleece you for your cash.  Everything is nestled into a small base village that you’d almost would think consisted of only the ticket office.  Unfortunately, this small sized base village is also Brighton’s downfall: on a busy weekend, good luck trying to find a place to sit inside to warm up while you eat lunch.  and the food service line—with only three checkouts—moves slower than the beginner hill quad.  We spent 15 minutes inside just trying to find someone who was within 10 minutes of getting ready to leave, so we could poach their table.  Otherwise, we were forced to sit outside the bathroom door to relax and warm up.  Brighton’s teeny tiny base village came back to haunt the customers on this busy weekend.  Although Brighton can turn the tables on this and say, “we’re focused on skiing and snowboarding,” people still need a place to relax, drink a Redbull, and recharge their batteries for more epic skiing.

In another  review of Brighton, someone mentioned that the lifties don’t do a very good job managing lift lines.  This may be true for the bottom half of the mountain, but once you get to the topside, liftlines (what few I participated in) moved quick and efficiently.  Although, to the reviewer’s credit below, I rarely saw lifties as they were mostly hiding in their warming house.  This may either mean that the customer’s who used the upper moutain’s lifts were just smart enough to pair up, or the upper half of the mountain just wasn’t used enough due to the whipping winds and cold.  Either way, the liftlines on the busy Saturday we spent at Brighton moved quickly and efficiently, and I have no complaints there.  Most of my complaints are reserved for the smallish base village—which is a surprise, considering that Brighton is managed by the same company that runs Big Sky MT.

While Brighton doesn’t have the expansiveness as Park City or the epic terrain of Snowbird or Alta, it does have it’s perks.  It’s the perfect  for high intermediate to advanced skiers and snowboards to go and level up their abilities.   trees and backcountry are shorter, less burly technical runs that have a built in comfort factor due to their size.  That doesn’t mean that hairball terrain exists (it does), it’s just that most of the time at Brighton, you will find yourself in a scary situation that you can always get out of.  While the groomers were alive and kicking with ski schools (and the quality of the groomers rates high,) I think Brighton is probably the least family friendly of s.  Stick with your Park City or Deer Valley for that.  To me, it just seems like the terrain you get at those s is greater for moms and dads and kids to utilize.  Brighton may just be too small for a “family” .  and if you get a chance, shoot through the park and check out some of the hits and rails they have—some of the coolest (although few in number) that I’ve seen in Utah.

Brighton ranks #3 in my list of Utah ski s (right behind Alta and Snowbird), because I enjoy the variety of terrain and the fact that there’s always snow to be had.  I also enjoy that the terrain is always a bit more friendly to my limited ability skiing, and anything that ends up being too burly for me to handle is always forgiving at the end.",Richard 1
730,2007-01-12,Utah,Solitude Mountain,3,"I felt the need to respond to the negative review of Solitude's RFID lift ticket system.  I think the system works great!  I rarely have a problem activating the gate on my first try.  I keep the pass in my pocket and just slide right up next to the reader and gently lean towards it.   gate actually does make a sound when it reads your card, maybe that person just has bad hearing.  and I've never had trouble getting through the gate in the time window provided.

It doesn't get any easier.   operators were friendly and fun.  re was one employee not in the loop but the manager sought him out for ""educating.""

751,2007-01-14,Colorado,Vail,5,"This past Saturday was a POW POW day for sure!!!  and...you didn't need to look hard to find freshies!   ride to Vail took about 2 hours from Denver because of the ""safe"" driving on the icy roads east of Summit County.  We were on our ski's by 9:30 and skied hard until abou 2:30.   day started out being beautiful and sunny.  I actually had to open my vents on my jacket and helmet.  I skiied on Seldom for my first time.  I often will  drop into Ricky's Ridge, but I wanted to try something new.  It was great!!!  We had some great POW POW shots!    snow was excellent.  We found powder to be waist deep in certain areas.   

and then...all of a sudden, we found ourselves skiing through the cloud while in China Bowl.  

Even though we were in the cloud, we still had to venture to Blue Sky.  Blue Sky was a bit tracked up...well very tracked up...HOWEVER, we still found freshies.  It was just that kind of day.  

Vail still ranks number 1 in my book for s that are part of the Colorad Pass.  No matter what day I find myself at Vail, I seem to always find nice pow pow and often freshies.    is big enough to offer this type of great skiing.

807,2007-01-17,Vermont,Killington,4,"I like Killington.  Over New Years they made alot of snow and kept the guns going.  But with the warm weather, conditions slipped considerably the following weekend.  Generally there is plenty of terrain for all abilities.   restaurants are very good.  re are alot of singles in the area, but plenty of things for families too.",tom travis
808,2007-01-17,Vermont,Pico Mountain,4,"Pico is a nice place, the mountain itself has the goods, especially in the trees.  In bounds the expert terrain is very limited though.  In general the terrain is limited and it does not handle crowds well, thankfully outside of holidays there are no crowds. re is no terrain park not even small features most times.   Snow making is a joke, in years past they had capacity issues but now this year with totally upgraded snowmaking capabilities they do not use it, pretty much 49er and pike see snow guns the rest get ignored it is mostly natural skiing.  Pico ski school is great but all other facilities are kind of ignored.  My advise is come here when natural snow is around and really only if you are looking for a family experience.  We come with the kiddos because we like the ski school more than Killington and it is much easier to pick up and drop off without totally messing up your ski day.  We like it but many of our more experienced friends will come for a day or so and get bored so go to Killington.   other issue they have is antiquated lifts that malfunction far too often.  It does have charm though and is totally unlike Killington, it is a different world and one that unfortunately often is neglected.  Sometimes it seems like they don't remember it is even there, if you do dense woods it skis a lot bigger than it seems and frankly has better and more straightforward terrain than anything outside of bear at K.  If you are an inbounds skier and not a beginner do yourself a favor and go to Killington unless there has been a massive dump.   other problem is the that 49er gets totally destroyed as it is the only thing people go down.  Pricing used to be really good but now at $89 for a day ticket it is a bit steep given the lack of snow making.",tom travis
809,2007-01-17,Vermont,Sugarbush,5,"Sugarbush is focused on skiing, not frills. It has delightful runs off the Super Bravo quad, including Downspout, Valley House Traverse, Snowball and Spring Fling. A ride up Heaven's Gate Triple ends up at the top of Organgrinder, an unrelenting    but groomed    fall line trail. It's one of seven really tough trails off the lift.  On my visit, J.J. Toland of Sugarbush led a couple of fast, top to bottom runs down Jester, a rollicking, rolling trail off Lincoln Peak, over to Gate House quad, up to North Lynx Triple, with several runs off that lift. It's a hike, but worth it. It takes a while to learn how to ski this area's 115 trails and 17 lifts    with elevations of 2,400 feet off Lincoln Peak, 2,237 off Castlerock (with eight really tough runs), 1,725 off North Lynx, and 2,650 feet off Mt.

810,2007-01-17,Pennsylvania,Elk Mountain Ski,5,"If you’re looking for an East coast ski hill north of DC and south of New England, Elk Mountain offers just about the most vertical (1000’, second in PA only to Blue Knob’s 1072’) and varied and challenging terrain you’ll find in the region.  Most importantly, it consistently offers the best snow in the area.  Elk is a throwback mountain in character and style, with an authenticity worn in from having been around since 1959.  Where Killington often bills itself as Aspen East, Elk mountain has the warm, carefree, wood paneled 70’s style that makes it something of a Jay Peak south.  

Located about 2 hours north of Philadelphia and 2.5 hours from New York City, Elk is accessible to the region’s major metropolitan centers, but seems to be just far enough away to avoid getting overrun by Philly and New York daytrippers. Elk is nestled in Pennsylvania’s Endless Mountains, and holds 27 trails on 140 acres, and a grand new Stompin’ Grounds terrain park.  Elk runs five double chairs, and one fixed grip quad; four of these, including the quad, take you from the base to the summit, allowing for continuous top to bottom runs across the mountain’s entire terrain.  mix of trails at Elk allows all levels of expertise to be entertained, from novice greenies to those looking for some steep thrills. 

Eleven of the 27 trails are expert, 10 are intermediate cruisers, 6 are for beginners, and seven trails are lit for night skiing, including the terrain park.  This abundance of variety for advanced skiers and riders is superior in the eastern Pennsylvania region, and is complimented by multiple longer, winding routes which are the appeal of Elk for many regulars.  Beginners can explore green top to bottom runs on their own, or enlist in Elk’s certified learn to ski and ride programs. Throw in the Stompin’ Grounds park, with multiple kickers, rails, and boxes, and you’ve got a complete mountain. 

Elk has sufficient off mountain amenities; the base complex features a large day lodge, all guest services, the ski school center, the Winter Garden Restaurant and Bar, rentals, and a ski and board shop.  As a , however, Elk is limited by a lack of après ski offerings and mountain accessible lodging. re’s no lodging on the mountain itself, and limited offerings within ten miles.   best options are Oliveri’s Crystal Lake Hotel, the Stonebridge Inn and Restaurant, both within 10 miles, and several smaller B&Bs that can be sifted through on Elk’s website. 

What ultimately separates Elk, however, is the snow.  As any skier knows, the snow makes the experience.  Without sufficient snow cover, the best mountains are little more than frustration, while enough soft whiteness can make a steep back hill a great run. Elk’s snow quality and grooming have been ranked the best in PA by Ski Magazine readers for two years running, and ranked in the top 10 in all the East.  and while they get 5 feet of natural snow annually, at Elk’s latitude these days, the rave reviews frankly mean that they know how to make the stuff.  Elk cover’s 100% of its terrain with snowmaking, and makes the most of it with excellent grooming.  result is that if it’s cold enough, they’re skiing.  If you’re in the neighborhood and looking for the place to carve some satisfying turns, Elk is the place to get your fix.  ",tom travis
820,2007-01-19,Washington,Alpental,4,"Just a quick update.   constant snow and moderate temps (a little cold for a week) have really stacked up the hill and stabilized the base.  Upper gates have consistently been open, giving access to lots of stashes back there.  Upper traverse has been open (but slipping down some from the cliff), so you get a fast traverse over, great fresh descent, and fast skate back.  Don't go back w/o a friend and knowledgable Alpie, but hard to pass up if you have the right stuff.  Nash is getting cut, but still holding turns on the sides.  Snake Dance is hoppy.  You'll have a hardpack surface under 3 4 inches overall.  Makes for skiddy turns with a litttle grab.  Keep the legs turning and ski pointed downhill.  Lap it up!",anhillx
821,2007-01-19,Washington,Crystal Mountain Washington,4,"I skied Crystal between Christmas and New Year's, one of the busiest times of the year for any ski , and it only snowed a little bit when I was there. at the Snorting Elk for Apres ski, my local friends were lamenting this fact over a pitcher of a rather strong local beer called ""Bi frost"" or something like that. No snow, and during such a busy time can't be good, right? I almost agreed, but stopped to realize: I'd just skied a steep and narrow, albeit short, chute (with boot deep wind loaded pow); a wide bowl (a little deeper); trees (knee deep, and completely untouched since the storm 5 days prior); and a demanding mogul run. All in one 2500' vertical run. and I'd done runs very similar to this for all four days that I was there! 

Crystal Mountain, of which I'd heard little previously, has nudged a few very good ski s down a notch or two on my favorites list. Oh, there was hardly any terrain park at all, even with the 8 feet of base, but there are ample cliffs and natural booters to huck yourself off, and well worn downed trees to rail slide.

Here's a picture of Mt. Rainier, with its unique lenticular clouds to the looker's left of the mountain.  Anybody from lower intermediate ability and above can ski from where this photo was taken. Another reason Crystal rocks.",anhillx
822,2007-01-19,Washington,Stevens Pass,2,"I first skied Stevens back in the early '70s when I was in junior high school.  I later blew my ACL in college and took the next 25 years off.  Going back to Stevens for the first time last season I was both pleased and disappointed.   base area is vastly improved (save for still having a rope tow to get from the lower to upper facilities   never hear of a handle tow?  Wanna buy me some new gloves?).  But returning to Stevens after so long was like returning to your grade school   wasn't this place a lot bigger?

I used to love Stevens when comparing it to Snocrummie Summit where I spent my first year of skiing.  However, my first time back on skis three seasons ago was at Vail.  Yes, I'm jaded, but even Crystal is lacking when you start comparing it and other Washington areas to real mountains. That being said, we spent New Year's weekend at Mission, and I'd forgotten that when you ski chair two top to bottom you are getting a full 2,000' of vertical.  You need to take two chairs to do that even at Crystal.  Throw in the lack of crowds and far fewer snowboarders, and Mission may be the best skiing experience in Washington. Harbour Properties selling Mission was, apparently, the best thing that could have happened to it.

While it's great that Stevens' upgraded Barrier (what's this ""Skyline"" nonsense) to a high speed quad, why are Chief and Brooks the same 30+ year old lifts, and why oh why didnt' they put high speed detachable quads in Mill Valley? and do you think you could spend more time grooming back there and perhaps re contour some of the slopes?  and why hasn't the base of Daisy been moved north, and why isn't it a high speed detachable quad? Etc., etc.

Stevens staff leaves a bit to be desired as well.   lift lines at Barrier, er, I mean Skyline and Hogsback are poorly managed, and the ski patrol needs to get on the literally hunders of boarders about parking their butts in the middle of runs all over the mountain.  It may be a lost cause as most of them seem to have no hill sense anyway.  I guess when boarders take all three of their lessons none of them include instruction on common courtesies or even common sense.

Okay.  Off my soap box and done foaming at the mouth. In short, Stevens is still a good mountain for mid week skiing.  But forget weekends and holidays.",anhillx

957,2007-01-29,New Mexico,Pajarito Mountain,3,"Unfortunately, as of January 8, 2007 it will be necessary to pass through a checkpoint for Los Alamos National Laboratory to get to this Ski Area.   NNSA (National Nuclear Security Agency) is claiming that they will only delay your vehicle for a few seconds while they look to see who is riding in your vehicle.  But many people think that they will go back on their word, and start doing full searches.  RVs and large trucks are already subject to searches.  re is a bypass planned eventually, but this may still be several years in the future; as the Los Alamos County Government is trying to make the bypass funding dependant on approval of their other grandiose development plans.

It is still possible to avoid the checkpoints by taking the road past Bandelier National Monument; but this is a winding, slow road with few spots to pass slower vehicles.  It is several miles further and 15 or 20 minutes longer to get to Parajito this way, from the Santa Fe area.

This  is huge, but I don't think I found one really good groomed run except the road down to the village (Mountain. run).  Although this was the least favorite of the four s I went to in Tahoe (Kirkwood, Sierra and Northstar), the beginners park off of the Belmont lift made a bad day into a good one for me.   park has at least a dozen different rails, 4 kickers and a medium size jump   I suggest spending the day here if you don't find fun on the ""groomers"".

1042,2007-02-05,New York,Belleayre,4,"Up until this year, I've bought a season pass at nearby Plattekill so hadn't visited Belleayre too often.  I was there yesteday, thanks to the Potter Brothers ski shop Flex Day promotion ($19.95 lift ticket).  I arrived around 10am and there was still plenty of parking.  Runs that were open had plenty of snow (99% man made variety) with the exception of the mogul run which was skied off and had a few bare spots    but NO ICE anywhere    a rare treat for eastern mountains.  Overall, excellent conditions, especially in light of the paucity of natural snowfall this season.   main lift    the Super Chief high speed detachable quad had lift lines of under 5 minutes and the other lifts had no lines to speak of at all (30 seconds tops).

    Belleayre has some interesting terrain although there is significant grade inflation (i.e., they have trails marked double diamond that might be marked intermediate blue at Jackson Hole) and all the trails flatten out significantly over the bottom 1/2 of the runs.

    Food prices in the lodge seem to have risen significantly over last year, with no discernible corresponding increase in quality.

     Nonetheless, if you want to ski within a reasonable travel time of NYC on weekends, Belleayre is hugely preferable to Hunter or Windham where you will face more crowds, more inexperienced skiers/riders, longer lines for lifts and food service, and longer walks to your car at the end of the day.",Art Zinn
1044,2007-02-05,Michigan,Big Powderhorn Mountain,5,"My first trip to Big Powderhorn was a real treat.  First of all, I was spending a day off from my real job, staying in Hurley WI (just across the Wisconsin border) and relaxing with some friends.  Second of all, I got a chance to ski some of next year’s skis too.  n, the real kicker: 8"" of fresh snow on top of an already fantastic base of all natural snow.   stoke level was high as I clicked in to ski Big Powderhorn for the first time.

It had been almost 24 hours since the 8” (this is the ’s estimate…in actuality, I think it was closer to a foot of snow), but my friends and I could see from the parking lot that there was still fresh snow or minimally tracked snow to poach.  It was Monday, and the parking lot was empty.  We got tickets from the friendly staff (a mere $40 as well, not a bad price at all) and headed up the chair immediately to the right of the chalet.   old center pole lift scooped us up and slowly dragged us to the top of the main peak.  We dropped in and skied some of the softest corduroy this side of the Rockies.  re wasn’t a single scrapping noise of skis on ice as we sliced down the run.  We got to the same chair, gave each other a nodding approval, and headed back up.  We know the groomed snow was great…but could we find some fresh stuff?

 answer was yes, and a big freaky yes at that.  We got off the same lift and cut further to skiers right, coming down a run that had not been groomed on one half of a split at the top of a steep ridge (the run is called “Double Barrel” I believe).  Located right to skier’s right of the lift we were lapping, the trail peaks out at the top of a ridge, and splits into two forks (hence the “Double Barrel” I would assume).   shorter, less steep skier’s left fork was groomed out, but the longer, slightly steeper skier’s left was all fresh with no tracks.  We bombed this run—getting a little more air than expected over the ridge—and tracked through fresh snow, as powder shots came up to our knees.  Big Powderhorn was quickly ranking high as one of my favorite Midwest ski s.

We lapped Double Barrel a few more times, then headed to chair 4 and skied the chute under the lift (a nice, rolling steep) and Katie’s Catwalk: a narrow, slightly snowed chute next to chair 4.  We found a few mini stashes of fresh snow, but for the most part, the chutes were icy at most parts.  My only assumption for this was that the wind was whipping directly up this part of the hill, leaving the chutes barren.  It was no matter, however, as the runs here were a nice change to Big Powderhorn’s relatively flat terrain.  While we were able to thus far find steep runs, most of Powderhorn’s terrain is flat, or slowly rolling out, so you don’t get up to the speeds you may want.  By the time you do, your run is over and it’s back to the chair.  So we continued our quest to find fresh snow and steep terrain.

We pushed all the way to skier’s right and found a long, wide green run.  It was pretty flat, but we gained enough speed to poach fresh snow on the bottom half of the run.  We took the chair up and repeated a few times.  We hadn’t found anything steeper than the chutes or the front run we hit earlier, so we soon returned to lap these instead.

Big Powderhorn is an excellent beginner’s mountain, with plenty of terrain to challenge any entry level to high intermediate skier.   terrain is also varied, which adds to the challenge.  But skiers looking for steeps may want to look somewhere else.  re’s also no tree skiing available, so you’ll have to look somewhere else in the UP for that as well.

What Powderhorn lacks in terrain is instantly made up by the staff and the staff’s attitude.  I was put off originally by the rental shop at Big Powderhorn: they were renting old, nearly unshaped skis with rear entry boots.  I was appalled.  I thought for sure that this was going to reflect an old school mentality among the staff: that shaped skis and kids skiing in baggy pants were what’s going wrong with the sport (when, in essence, it’s these people who hold the sport back).  So you can imagine my surprise when the liftie took a look at our next gen shaped skis and said “awesome sticks.”  Right away, I knew that this place was different from all the other old school ski s out there.   other thing that set aside Big Powderhorn from all the other old, crusty s was their policy on grooming: unlike Lutsen, MN and Spirit Mountain, MN, Big Powderhorn decided to give you an option on what you want to ski.  y smartly groom the flat runs that are mostly beginner runs, and then groom half of other runs and leave the other half available for those of us who wish to ski fresh snow or naturally occurring bumps.  What a great surprise this was.  Giving the consumer a choice—what a fresh concept of thinking.

 décor of Big Powderhorn may make you think that you are stepping into a time machine.  But essentially, this is the idea.  By giving off a throw back to the golden age of skiing, Powderhorn pays tribute to itself and it’s rich history.  It’s a little frighteningly tacky at times, but once you realize what you are surrounded by, you mind it less and less.   fact that the prices are reflected by this old school mentality is also welcomed.  $40 for a day pass, and only $9 to eat lunch (that’s a bowl of chili, a hot ham ‘n cheese sandwich, and a Powderade)…these prices are unheard of at many ski s.  Additionally, the staff isn’t narrow minded…they are friendly and very welcoming.  Big Powderhorn does everything right on the consumer end.

My only gripes are minimal about Big Powderhorn.  While the terrain may be flat, it’s varied enough to keep you interested and steeps can be found—short as they may be.   staff and prices are very friendly as well, and this could be an excellent family ski location as the terrain is highly conducive to beginner and intermediate skiers.   fact that the  makes great use of it’s lake effect snow—which pummels the  starting in mid January—is also very important to the overly critical skier (that’s me!).  Big Powderhorn is well worth stopping at if you are on your way to the UP.  You’ll enjoy the prices, terrain, and most of all: the snow!",Mike134
1057,2007-02-06,New Mexico,Angel Fire,4,"We have been to Angel Fire a few times over the past 2 seasons for skiing, and find it to be a great place, especially for families.   staff is helpful.

We are going back over Mardi Gras week..can't wait!  I do wish that they would find a better method of overnight ski storage...you have to go inside the ski rental shop and wait in line to buy a ticket (often takes 5 10 minutes) and then go to the valet outside to hand it to him so that he can issue you a bin.

1073,2007-02-07,Colorado,Wolf Creek,5,"I have no idea what the guy who says it never snows at WC is talking about.  I think he was thinking about Ski Apache or something.  We have been to Wolf Creek 3 or 4 times and it has always been great.  Sure it gets crowded on holiday weeks and the lines are longer for tickets, rentals, food, etc. but what  isn't?   staff has always been friendly and helpful and for the size of the mountain you get a lot of bang for the buck.  Most snow in CO and almost always has better early season snow than the others.  Also, Pagosa is a great little town with good dining and drinking spots and of course the hot springs.  Don't go without experiencing the hot springs. 

       I read a lot of these negative reviews and wonder if these people really
 even like to ski.  Some have valid complaints about poor service, bad
 attitudes by the staff, crappy facilities, etc.  Most just seem to be looking for 
something to complain about.  Bottom line:  Skiing is not for whiners, 
pessimists or wimps.  It's always going to be cold.  re will usually be lines 
and traffic and you'll have to walk a little ways to and from your car.   food
 will always be more expensive than at home.  Your boots will never feel like 
your house slippers.  Snow conditions will not always be perfect and the sun 
won't always be shining, but if you truly love to ski, then none of this will 
matter to you.  All that will matter is standing on top of a mountain and trying 
to decide which way and how fast you're going to go down it.

I almost missed the beginning of the bump jamboree because no one could tell me where to meet. Glad I got there though b/c it was the highlight of the trip and I highly recommend it.

No. Am I glad I did it? Of course. Would I go back? Probably not.   My advice: ski 1 2 days here, but stay in Breck/Key/Vail.

1213,2007-02-19,Colorado,Purgatory Mountain,4,"2/15 2/17 Powder conditions first two days made the skiing great. A few things everyone needs to know about DMR though. First, it is a 30 minute drive from DMR to Durango and there is no apres ski at DMR to speak of. Second, it is not a place for a beginner because the only way to base area is a blue called Demon, and it is steep and fast. Go somewhere else to learn (locals recommend Wolf Creek) then try DMR. Third, the double chair to head toward lift 5 & 8 is SLOW! Also, the lift 8 double is slow and you have to get on mid mountain unless you can do blacks to the base of lift 8. Fourth, compared to Breck or Whistler the runs are short, but no so much so that you won't have lots of funs (I certainly did). Fifth, Harris Hill run is what some places refer to as advanced blue or blue black. Make sure you are a good blue skier before choosing that run (but man is it fun!). Sixth, the signage at DMR is HORRIBLE! You will not find signage for several of the runs, you will miss turns since many are not marked, so go prepared and make sure all of your party knows what lift to meet at since that is often the only indicator of where you are to go. Seventh, the rental shop at DMR is small and slow and the lines can easily exceed an hour in length so think about renting in Durango, even if you wind up paying for an extra day you may find it worth it (especially if it is a holiday weekend). Finally, if you are going from DFW I recommend you fly Southwest Air Charter (800 525 0892) instead of driving up from Albuquerque, that is a LONG drive and you waste a day getting there and a day getting home. Also a warning, some Purgatory Townhome condo owners advertise their condos as ski in, ski out but they absolutely are not. y are however within walking distance as long as you are not wearing ski boots.

1337,2007-02-28,Wisconsin,Grand Geneva,1,"Skied here 1/26/20.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Sure, the hill isn't very high.  But there are a lot of interesting and challenging runs for any skill level.  It was the first time for the little kids in our family.   lessons were well organized and helpful and the beginner terrain was perfect for them.  
I skied on a Sunday and was very pleased to find out that, as a senior,  my lift ticket was half price, $27    not bad!
 only downside to Grand Geneva is that they want you to fill out a profile/liability form before skiing.  You can do it on the computers in the chalet, but the lines can be long.  But, you can also do this on line beforehand.  My advice is to fill this out the night before and then you can skip the lines.

Its a good idea to bring your own food   I actually eat the lunch I brought in my car everytime, since if u go early u can park close enough so that the nearest chairlift is only 20 feet away.

Night life, call it sleep and refresh  not much there, but not needed, this is a place to ski like you have never skiied before, take a late afternoon gallery stroll in the town and enjoy the rich history of the area. Advice on time  ski early, the way the sun is positioned the light flattens out by 2:00. When doing a 1/2 day  go early  no lift lines, oh  well, maybe one time in 4 days there was a 3 chair wait. Chairs are a little slow  but if they had high speeds like Utah, your legs would be done in too quickly. Try it , you will love it.",steffenwolf

We skied Taos (the best) on Thurs. and were planning on doing Taos again Fri. and Sat.  but our son and a friend came down from CO Fri. morning and since they board we had to go back to Angel Fire.

1447,2007-03-09,California,Heavenly Mountain,4,"Of all the Lake Tahoe s, we ski Heavenly most often because of proximity to family & friends living nearby and the apres ski options in South Lake & Stateline.  Where else can you ski/ride all day then step off a gondola, walk a block, and sit down to a fine dinner, first class entertainment & a lively game of Texas Hold'em all in one day?  base & on mountain facilities are modern & well maintained and the views from Heavenly's California side are easily second to none anywhere in the US. However, this is neither a very novice friendly or even a real expert mountain.  ""green"" trails are mostly flat & boring and the true double diamonds are few & either inaccessible or closed. Though the grooming is excellent & most cruisers are fast & varied, overall excitment & challenge is somewhat lacking where most ""blue"" trails miss the ""wow factor"" of the likes of Squaw, Kirkwood & Alpine Meadows. Most of the chairlifts, though old, are well positioned & fairly adequate.  But the Top of Gondola & Snow Beach areas can become crowded ""horror scenes"" even during weekdays! Experience over the years has taught us to avoid skiing Heavenly on weekends & holidays, bring our own food & beverage, rent equipment off mountain (50% cheaper & better techs), and either arrive at one of the four base areas quite early or take a shuttle.  Still, Heavenly is a fine mountain , just not the best of the Tahoe basin.   ",seniordude
1488,2007-03-14,Colorado,Telluride,5,"I have skiied out west at 7 s now, as well as a slew of s in New England, and Telluride was undoubtedly the best. Telluride has everything you need in a trip, all squeezed into one small, stunning box canyon.  amazing thing is that Telluride provides everything that you could get at a behemoth like Breckenridge and more, and does it with less acres and trails, a smaller town, a much smaller ego, and NO CROWDS.  mountain has the reputation as being a daredevil's mountain because of its steeps, so it took a lot of convincing to go there. Well sure enough all 8 of us on the family trip had a great time.  old town is wonderful, we had a great condo for a great price, and those in the family who got tired by lunchtime had a great tiem walking down Main Street, shopping, etc.  less experienced skiers loved Prospect Bowl. It gave them a chance to ski isolated, natural, high alpine terrain that was gentle enough for their liking. For the serious skiers, myself included, Telluride was a blast.  steepness of some of the runs on Gold Hill can't be described. andy's Gold is a ""can't miss"". I also loved Buzz's Glade. If you love the bumps like I do, head to the front side. World class mogul lines! My favorite trail of all, however, was the East Drain. If you've never skied a riverbed, you gotta try it. Last, and certainly not least, Telluride has some of the best scenery anywhere. I'd say it is as pretty as Lake Tahoe. Telluride isn't as hard to get to as everyone says, but I'm glad people think it is, I enjoyed feeling like I had the greatest mountain in North America to myself. But now that I've let you in on this little secret, don't pass it up. It will be the best ski vacation you take, and the rest of your family and friends will feel the same way, no matter what kinda stuff they are into.",sampanning

CB is perfectly situated so you have no hwy's with the noise and crowds.   mountain is laid out great especially for boarders, no flat spots.  Only place that compares to Taos for consistent pitch all over.  Plenty of challenging blue, black and double black terrain.   village on the mountain is really cool.   town looks like it is right out of the Old West.   food is great and the few bars we ventured into left us with a desire to go back and hang out again for sure.   people were very friendly and you got the impression that they were very happy with where they were and that they would be there for awhile.  We've been there twice and have decided if we can ever afford a place in the mountains it will definitely be CB.   only downside, which is also its upside, is it's a long way to another  if you want a change of pace from your ""home"" mountain.

1542,2007-03-19,New Jersey,Mountain Creek,1,"I agree with all the people complaining about the way they run this mountain of late. I have gone there 3 times for a twilight session (cost $35 midweek) and the access to the south peak was closed except to ticket holders.

Also i noticed that they had groomed 3 4 runs that were very nice, and that they closed them to save them for the weekend.We paid for an entire mountain and were only able to access about 15% of it . Full price for 15% of terrain. Would you stand for 15 cents in exchange for $1 in a bank ? In the end we only had a choice of 2 3 short intermediate and expert runs to ski over and over again.

I used to go there years ago and remember a much larger variety of runs open both day and night. y turned off the gondola, closed the sothern sojourn run,and the only people who had access to the south peak were the people with season passes. So bottom line if you are not a season pass holder you really get screwed over .

y have adopted a really stingy business model that maximizes their profits and minimizes your skiing/ snow boarding experience.

Do not give them any more of your money it just reinforces the idea that they can screw the day trippers and get away with it .

No refrigerator, microwave and bad TV reception.   I must mention that the bedding was awful..  I left this place with a sore back.  (it wasn't from skiing).

Unfortunate, because we truly had a great time skiing and our children had a blast at the ski school with two really good instructors.  However, the last hour, we were going to one last ski lift with our 9 and 7 year old sons who had been skiing all day and getting on and off the lifts without a problem.  When we arrived at the lift, the lift attendant, for reasons unknown to us, proceded to push my 9 year old son onto the chair lift causing him to fall and in turn causing me to fall with him.  We became entangled and had fallen flat on our faces, as I tried to get up, I saw another chair coming my way.  With no time to duck far enough, the metal chair hit the back of my head at full speed causing a mild concussion to my head.  My son became quite upset as his arm had been twisted in the process.  When this happened, the lift attendant told us that we weren't allowed to ride the lift because of my 9 year old's actions!  No apology for what the attendant had done was given and when we talked to the customer service center, the person at the desk didn't want to discuss it with us because we were ""too irrate.""  Huh?  Wouldn't any normal person who has just been hit over the head with a metal chair coming at full speed at him be irrate?!  To top it off, when we went to pick up our 4 year old daughter from the school, the instructor said she had already been picked up.  After frantically looking all over for her and going back to the instructor to ask him to help me look for her, he smirked and said he had no idea where she was!  I finally found her outside with another instructor, but it was the hell that I went through just to find her that made me in such distress.   school didn't apologize for the oversight and no one acted like they cared why I would be upset at not finding my daughter.

I recomend arriving early on a weekend. y open the season late due to no snowmaking ability, and close early in the season due to dwindling crows/melting snow. 

I love it for the fact that on a clear day I can get from my house to there in an hour and a half. On weekdays I rarely ride a chair with anybody. Usually I am one of 50 skiers/riders.

First let me start by saying....  I am from Texas!!!!
We had a WONDERFUL time at DMR and already booked our Christmas again!
We have skied other places and love Durango. I am a beginner and didn't have a problem w/ the runs. If you ask (can't remember the name)what run comes from the area to the left of the high speed lift, you can cut across Demon from there and not actually come DOWN the black, your just cruising across at an angle! My 6 year old did a 2 hour private lesson and was skiing blues the rest of the time...Even a black when she took a wrong turn! Glad she was w/ dad and not me... ha ha All the kids had a blast and are so excited that were heading back, this time w/ friends from church in tow!
Just so ya know... we love DMR and all the folks there, and we in Texas aren't all that bad!
See ya on the slopes!!!! (I'll be the one in the pizza wedge) ha ha

But for a Massachusetts ski area it has some great, steep terrain.  Never was a fan of skiing at Massachusetts mountains, but this is the one place I will go.  Night skiing is always a good yet novel time.  If there is a good winter, the Spring skiing isn't too bad either.    value is great as well, you won't get stripped from your cash as much as you would further north.    ",Ritt

I started on Spruce Peak and had a blast.  lifts were fast and there were no real lines. On the Mansfield side after riding the  crossover gondola I went on the gondola to the summit.  gondola was wicked fast and there were no lines again.  trails were huge, they were wide and long.  only thing that was not great was the 25 minute wait for the fourruner quad.

What a great mountain!  Or should I say 2 mountains.   lower village is serviced by intermetiate/beginner lifts and the opposite facing mountain, serviced by the upper village is intermetiate to double black.  Lots of well groomed cruisers with parallel tree and powder runs.

Snowfall can be a problem.  Low levels of snow will limit mountain accessibility on some runs.  Generally mountain is well prepared for skiing on small amounts of accumulation.

2071,2007-11-24,Colorado,Wolf Creek,5,"Well I just got through reviewing my other favorite southwestern ski area (Taos), and so I thought I’d toss in my two cents about Wolf Creek as well. I cant say which is better because the two of them play to different strengths. and Wolf Creek’s forte is the POW. Yes, you gotta love it when you get to Pagosa Springs late on a Friday night and you notice the snow flakes start drifting down from above. 

Heaven is a place on Earth when you ski at Wolf Creek after a long snowy night. Even without new snow I still like the variety of terrain the area has to offer, but it’s really the powder days that knock you out –  oh, that light, fluffy, rocky mountain powder. If you werent able to tell, I’ve relocated from the Southwest to the wet cement, snow region of the Northwest, and something is definitely missing from my life.
 
Overall, the ski area is small and quaint with a local feel to it that I find infinitely more appealing than the larger commercial operations in Summit County, CO (except you my sweet, little and yet naughty A basin). I havent been there since they installed the new lift for the back area, and I can only hope to try it out sometime soon. I only lament that it’s opened up an area that was exclusively for the hiking/traversing type and so the snow probably gets tracked sooner. 

Never mind. Im probably being silly since that place never seems to run out of great snow and hidden caches of pow. As far as the negative reviews here, they’re probably protective locals trying to keep their little piece of Nirvana hidden and to themselves. and don’t forget to relax in the public springs along the river in Pagosa after you’ve had a long day of snow snorkeling.  ",yodeledihoo

It is not a  but a day trip for skiing that truly has some great qualities. First, the runs are longer and challenging and the mountain has some height (and views) y are grooming very regularily, breaking up ice and moguls on the runs. I rarely see ice during the day (unlike K mart) y have a very high speed quad and some reliable twosies that will get you up in a little over a minute.  disembark is great, you won't crash into people like ""Bear Creek""(theworststaffandtrailsgohere) and Snowboarders can get themselves together away from skiiers. If it snows Blue accumulates great (ha)powder for the east, and in the spring it stays nice and fluffy until 4pm or so. Avoid any Eastern  on the weekends, it is murder, and yes people from NJ and NY crowd in. But good for them, this is where we practice for Colorado and Tahoe. y need a new lower lodge, it is a 70's cafeteria, and they need more trails. Better than Camelback (by far) and Seven Springs (though that has glades) but go to Killington or Mt.Snow if you want to enjoy skiing. Sidewinder park is fun for boarders but so are the trails. Great learning program, though don't bring your toddlers, you concieted fools. No one under 6 should be on grown up slopes. Don't sit in the middle of vista you retard riders.  Vista lodge is small but the drinks flow and you can ski afterward to the base. Blue can be pricey, so go to pinnacle or Buchmans and get discounts. I think there ski shop is the best i've rented, even though they do have some choppy ski's in the back on busy days. Did I mention this is the best place in PA or NJ?

2191,2007-12-04,Colorado,Keystone,1,"I am from the east coast and moved to Colorado 15 months ago for business.  majority of the 2006 ski season we (my wife and I) skied at Keystone and enjoyed every minute of it. Let me give you a little background on our experience's. 

For starters, I have skied on both the east coast and west coast, and now here in the Colorado Mountains. I also have other family members here in Colorado that ski. A few years ago a family member was hit by a out of control snowborder at Breckenridge and nearly killed, she was my mother, during the trial they determined by physics and geometry that the 20 year old was going between 45mph and 50mph. 

My wife and I started the 2006 ski season at Breckenridge in the first few weeks of operation. On every trip to the  we encountered problems. As an example, we were standing in line and people were throwing trash (drink bottles they had just finished on the ground instead of in the trash can a few feet away, the're minimal ski patrol policing the mountain if any, I was run into by both snowboarders and by skiers). Often, while skiing down the run you could hear people on the chairs swearing and smell the pot they were smoking. I think the major problem for me and my wife (we are 36 and 30yrs old) was the fact that the mountain was not policed for out of control skiers or patroled in any mannor at all   ever that we witnessed.  over all atmosphere was that of a thug environment. By the way I am a snowboarded! and that's a whole nother story. 

After a few more trips up we decided to try KEYSTONE. What a difference. From day one we had a blast.  staff and people that ski this mountain are an entirely different crowd it seems. We were refreshed to see that the mountain was actually policed by ski patrol, clean and more managed. All the runs are easy to get to and fun. I would strongly suggest that you STAY AWAY FROM BRECKENRIDGE and focus on one of the BEST   KEYSTONE!!!",highvoltageguy

But once you are on the mountain one needs to leave the $will behind and open your eyes.   runs only seem short because the over all terrain is compacted into smaller area than most s that boast a gagillion acres of skiable terrain. But if you take a tape to any of the bigger lines on the hill you would find them comparable , except for the fact that the pitches are sustained and steeper , to anywhere else in Colorado.  Yeah sure A basin has Pallavachinni (sp?), but thats it.   Further more the Aspen core skier does not just ski the lower mountain or the upper mountain for that matter.  You ski the whole mountain by linking these so called 'short lines' together into one 3200' vertical  top 2 bottom' no stop line.

Postings by others that Loveland is a skier/rider mountain are absolutely correct.

Massive amount of terrain, variety of terrain: everything from the most extreme 'in bounds off piste' skiing (Palisades) to an extensive beginner program, and awesome powder.  If you like to hike, the Granite Chief bowl (skiers left) has fantastic powder,  Palisades has epic chutes, and Broken Arrow peak has several lines for those who need to show off for the cable car.  KT 22 has some of the most challenging runs anywhere.   mogul masochists can get their fix on the face of Headwall.   tree runs down to Shirley are fun to cruise when the wind keeps the top from openning up, but the hidden gem of the mountain is Granite Chief.  While not as challenging as KT 22, Headwall, etc., it's tucked away location keeps the lift lines short on crouded days and it usually has the best snow when the wind keeps the other peaks closed.  If you can't find something here to keep you happy, turn in your rental equipment, go home and promise to never come back. You are taking up space.  

As for the new  renovations, please stop.  It's never going to be an alpine ski town in the Alps, or Vail, or Aspen, or whatever they are trying to make it.  Squaw has the feel of a mountain near the California/Nevada border in Tahoe, which is okay because it is a mountain near the California/Nevada border in Tahoe.  Tahoe has one of the most unique feels of any ski area in the world.   Alps are about the Apres Ski, Colorado mega s are about the 'scene' and being seen, and Tahoe is about the skiing.

Wide variety of terrain (admittedly short on the extreme end), above average amount of terrain, and some of the best on mountain food.  Before the opening of the backside of Lookout Peak, challenging terrain was in short supply.  Most of the expert runs are not super challenging, but if you are going to Northstar then you aren't looking for the extreme (that's why you go to Squaw or Alpine).   backside of the Pluto Peak has long, fun runs that are especially nice on fresh powder days.   East Ridge has some short but moderately challenging high speed cruisers and is generally less crowded than the West Ridge.   best tree skiing is also on the East Ridge.   Powder Bowl is, as it's name implies, filled with powder on fresh powder days.  While certainly not an expert mountain, I've had some of my best days skiing at Northstar.

It was contagious!   town has every option. You never tire of gondola with breathtaking views, and the uncrowded lifts make it easy to get in as many runs as you want. We have been to many s, both large and small. This place is the best by far.",horse

This year nature has helped with the temps and snow making for  great conditions and 90% open runs before New Years.More entertainment has been booked for the weekends and the locals remain some of the nicest people you ever wanted to ski and/or drink with.

Usually we ski on Ski Beach, but figured since through the week, the  Cat is open and fairly slow we'd try it out there... After all we never snowboarded before.  ladies at the counter were welcomeing and very much a riot, as well as the boardrental counter. We didn't find as much free advice as we did in Ski Beach, but we also didn't ask for much.  Once we started out , there was no real indication of a bunny hill and we just trudged our boards up the hill.  hill itself was alright, unfortunatly most of snow already melted at the bottom so we wiped out in slush.  After a little practice we decide to try the slopes. While the  lift operators were very supportive,  It was great until the end of the day when it got pretty cold.  blowers started at about 6 o'clock, so a thin pile of snow over the frozen ice started to form. It was kind of treacherous for a beginner.  Later on the crowd got thicker and we were no longer welcome. Maybe there's another place or time for a beginner?",mayham2k

2690,2008-01-03,North Carolina,Sugar Mountain,2,"I live in atlanta and am not affiliated with any ski area.  I don’t have any kids, so my perspective is that of someone who just wants to ski. I’ll offer my opinion on this site for all the NC ski areas I’ve tried: Sugar, Beech, Appalachian and Cataloochee.  

First  I’ll say here what I’ve said for all the others – this is North Carolina, so you can’t compare it to anything out west or even up north or W.VA.  It’s small and the snow is man made.  Don’t go on the weekend and God help you if you go on a holiday.  crowds will be massive.

But compared to other NC ski areas, here’s my opinion of Sugar Mountain.  Tragic disappointment.  Sugar is the biggest of the bunch and could be a great place to ski if they invested in it.  I’ve read most of the reviews on this site about Sugar, and all the negative ones, sadly, are true.  Sugar needs two main things: attitude adjustment and NEW EQUIPMENT.  ir lifts are the worst around.  y boast the highest vertical, yet sit you done in a chair that creeps up the hill. Even with no crowds, the lift ride time alone is enough to question even going to Sugar. Add in weekend crowds and you’re talking about 4 7 minutes to get down the hill.  20 45 minutes in lift line and another 10 minutes back up the hill.  It’s horrible.  Also, the chairs as so old, there’s no cushion left on them.  After a day there, the back of my legs were killing me from the chair slamming into me as I sat down.  A few reviewers noted the lift personnel were less than professional, and that also is true.  I experienced either indifferent teens (they seem to work all NC ski areas) or Hispanics who looked truly lost as to what they were supposed to do.  Forget them forming a line or slowing down the chair as you sit.  If anything, all they do is check tickets.  Sugar desperately need a high speed quad like any legitimate ski area.   

IF you go, check their site to see if Big Red is open.  My bother and I spent a day just on that slope/lift, and it wasn’t so bad.  However, you have to stay only on Big Red.  If you go all the way to the bottom, you have to ride TWO slow lifts to get back up. 

I’ve also experienced rude or indifferent personnel from the ticket window to the grill to the lift attendants.  One reviewer noted that they act is if they’ve got a captive audience or the best product around and therefore don’t have to treat their guest right.  I’d have to agree with that.  

My final recommendation: if you’re going to ski in NC, go to Beech.  y DO have a high speed lift, they have more runs from the top of their mountain, and their longest is comparable to Sugar’s longest run.",MgoBlue
2714,2008-01-04,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,4,"snowshoe has always been one of the best resports in the mid atlantic region. just got back from a 4 day trip from Dec 30 Jan 3. we were SOO lucky to have gotten almost 11 inches of snow to better some of the icy trails. lift tickets are a bit too expensive but it has some of the best terrain and ammenities in the region. free shuttle service around the mountain is a great service. while the natural powder we received was great, the blowing of man made snow made visibibility extremely low. we were there during the holiday season and the trails were overcrowded at times so it is wise to head over to silver creek. the terrain park had limited terrain for intermediate riders, the jumps and rails seemed to be geared for advanced riders and did not give me a chance to practice on smaller terrain. overall snowshoe is a quality place to which i will always return",MgoBlue

2809,2008-01-08,Oregon,Willamette Pass,5,Willamette pass offers some great skiing but I do have some serious issues with the quality of staff and services.  lift ticket lines are very slow(and yes the asses on the snow phone will lie about conditons). zombies in the ski corral had me wait for 15 minutes to check in my skis with 1 person in line ahead of me and charged two dollars every time I needed to secure my skis.  service in the bar area was horrible with my friend and I waiting almost 30 minutes for an over priced(and I swear watered down) beer. But problems with the staff aside you do go there to ski and personaly I think the terrain is great.  pass has some very good steep runs with incredible(for the Northwest)powder when conditions are right and good runs for beginners on the front side. I gave the terrain a 5 rating only because it is the best in bounds so close to my home. Everything else is piss poor.,Randy Rogers
2810,2008-01-08,Oregon,Hoodoo,2,Hoodoo is a great place to ski or ride aside from being kind of small. But the staff is friendly and helpful(compared to the brain dead morons who comprise Willamette passes staff)and there is some great skiing to be had when conditions are right.  ,Randy Rogers

2827,2008-01-09,Vermont,Killington,4,"I went to Killington for the first time on New Years Eve and New Years Day where they received about 18 inches of snow in the course of those two days. One word to describe it is ""amazing."" re is such an incredible variety of trails and terrain that makes you feel like you're skiing out west (though I'm a snowboarder). With the snow falling and ridiculous amounts of powder, it was like being in heaven and truly felt like a Colorado experience.  only negative things against Killington are first  and foremost is that the grooming is horrible. Even on a day where it was snowing, there were spots of a trail with tons of power and spots that were pure ice, or in other instances entire portions of trails were all ice, while others were full of powder. Next, the mountain can be too confusing to find your way around, especially for newcomers when i found myself spending half my time studying the trail maps to figure out where i was and where i wanted to go. Other than that, it was pretty good, though i probably won't be hurrying back there anytime soon. I recommend Stratton or Okemo, though they are a little more expensive it's definitely worth it. and by the way, Killington is an amazing party town with many bars, restaurants, and nightclubs no more than a mile or 2 from the mountain, so if you want to party and have fun off the mountain, Killington is definitely the place to be.",flyersboy114

2871,2008-01-11,Pennsylvania,Jack Frost,1,"Jack Frost may only have a 600 foot vert. That being said they do a lot with the limited height they have. y have a smart trail layout with the easier stuff to the west side and harder as you move east on the trail map. Families and beginners have plenty on the west side while the experts stay on the east side. Some of the blues in between (Lehigh) are a nice warm up for East Mt. and speaking of East Mt. there are some really fun steeps and bumps there (though a bit short lived). Signs are prominant warning skiers and riders that East Mt. is expert only terrain. For me, what makes JF really stand out is their glades. JF is the only area in Northeast PA that allows tree skiing, and after a snow fall it's really fun. In addition to that snow and grooming is usually really good.

2891,2008-01-12,Oregon,Willamette Pass,5,"Last week they were under reporting the snow levels, so it may all average out over a season.

I started boarding about 18 months ago and only do blue runs.  That is until last week.   powder was so deep and fine that I was not able to make it through to Boundary Pass and had to finish up by coming down Destiny through waist deep snow.  No one else had run it in several days, so I had to guess how to make it.  After I made it through one of the two track openings through the tops of all the small Doug Firs at the bottom, I decided that must be what all the excitement is about.

Being very close to Social Security eligibility and over weight, I find that the ski patrollers are quick to check me out if I stop in any one place too long to catch my breath.

All the lift operators and other staff seem very friendly and helpful to me, but maybe that is because I am smiling a lot while I am there.

 food is good enough that my teen age son and his friends are always eating it, and it is inexpensive enough so that I can afford to purchase enough to keep a small army on the move.

 kid who hit the roots of the downed tree last spring was right behind me.  I slipped on the same ice patch, but it was not due to any grooming defects.  If he had not hit the root ball, he would have hit the standing trees on either side of it.  It was just one of those freak accidents that happen, and not anyone's fault.

If you need a terrain park and do not go in for natural features, this may not be the best place to go, but then most of the best parks are in places with crummy snow and are made up to compensate.

Apres Ski is rated low on my list, as I seem to always get stuck behind some 80 year old in a Geo Metro without snow tires on the way home.  If Apres Ski to you is getting hammered and finding some companionship, you would be better off in San Francisco or Seattle.  A few rounds in any good bar there will end up costing more than a Willamette Pass lift ticket.",Randy Rogers
3035,2008-01-21,New Jersey,Mountain Creek,2,"I was a season pass holder from the first year Intrawest took over the MC until a few years ago.  In the beginning they made an honest effort to make MC a great experience but as the years went by they backed off spending the money it takes maintain great conditions.  y only make enough snow to ski on but not enough to make quality conditions.  It also seems skiing is only their side business and that property investment is their main concern.  y have soaked millions in land development as anyone that has been going there for a few years can see.  As for season pass holders the management doesn't care much for them.  y figure they can treat them like yesterday news and they will always come back.  Instead of making it easy to maintain the best price on season passes they make it difficult, they make you become a proxy sales person for them maintaining at least 4 people in your group to get their best price.   season pass holders should never be abused like this, it is understandable maybe to require the new season pass holders to jump through some hoops for their best season pass prices.  y should be doing whatever it takes to keep their old pass holders instead of making it harder.  For being a pass holder for nearly 10 years and then stoping you think they would contact me to find out why I stopped or if I forgot to renew, I haven't heard a peep out of them oh well.

 best thing that MC have done just about the very beginning is their terrain park for snowboarders.  y consistantly had some of the best setups on the east and even in the country.  I give them credit for that even though I don't used the park other than skiing through it to get to the bottom.  My son enjoyed the different features of the parks on Vernon and South Peaks.

Now MC isn't a bad place to ski for being located in NJ an dthe Pocono area but for better conditions you will need to drive a little further.  Elk Mountain, PA, Hunter & Gore Mountains, NY all have better snow conditions & most of the ski areas of VT. have much better terrain and snow.  y also don't skimp on snow making, if it is cold enough they make snow even when it is snowing.  I was a season pass holder of ASC until they they sold out their ownership and now a pass holderat Gore & Whiteface, NY seriuosly thought about Majic Mountain, VT.

3037,2008-01-21,Washington,Alpental,4," snow can be great, as well as it can be horrible.  lifts never have lines on week days and the snow stays perfect all day. It has one of the steepest ski runs in the state and is said to rival the steeps of Jackson Hole! By far the best place out of the other three Snoqualmie Pass areas to go to on a weekday!
On Weekends, that's a different story,  parking is very few and the lift lines for the express and top chair can be triple the time that it takes to get down and thats just the lift line!  Summit provides a shuttle service, but it's always slow and it has taken me up to a half hour and the bus is always crowded on staterday and sunday.  lift ops. don't seem to care about anything but their music. One operator screamed at anyone who did one small thing wrong, such as not moving fast enough to the line or not makeing a group of four even if there was no possible way!
 Do not waste your time here on a weekend but if you come here any time else, it's a blast

3039,2008-01-22,Virginia,Massanutten,4,"I had reservations from Dec. 16  23 at Woodstone Meadows.  Initially our stay was really nice but on the Friday night prior to our Sunday morning check out, there was a problem.  We found a living mouse in our unit.  I understand that those kind of things happen but the response from the front desk (in my opinion) was less than adequate.  I called to the front desk @ approximately 10:10pm and explained the situation.  I was told that maintenance was gone for the night and that they could send someone the next day to put down a trap.  I told the clerk that I was not staying in the room with a mouse.  He offered the unit directly below us and stated that because the way the units were designed that the mouse could not get down there.  I told him that I was very apprehensive about staying in the unit directly under where we were presently staying.  He said the choice was mine and that he was sending ""Security"" over with the new key.  To keep a long story short, ""Security"" came and we checked out.  
 
re was no concern for the inconvenience that this incident posed to my family.  We had to throw away food that the mouse got into, dried foods and fruits that were on the counters, and the food that we could not bring back up the road (milk, eggs, ground beef).  I purchased 3 day water park passes for my family that we only used one day of.  It changed our Christmas plans because on December 23 we planned to visit family in Roanoke, Va not December 21.  We had nowhere to stay, so we went back home to Maryland.

3068,2008-01-22,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"For this years annual ski vacation we picked to go to Breckenridge from January 6 11, since previous years we had been to Vail, Beaver Creek, Keystone, and other surrounding s. Our group consisted of 10 total people so we chose to stay at the Wedgewood lodge. It is located on 4 O'clock road about 150 yards down from the Snowflake lift.  lodge itself was very nice and accommodated the group well.  only problem was the hot water and pressure when it came time for showers, other than that it was perfect. 

As for the mountain itself, it was awesome. It snowed 4 of the 5 days we were there and only got icy our last day. Another storm blew in on Friday, making our exit from Breck a little slow. To do the group ski thing, we found peak 7 runs the most fun. With ample blue trails fit for most of our experience range. I did get to see most of the mountain (7, 8, 9, &10 peak) but never got up to the T bar and the bowls. A+ in my book. We’ll probably be coming back next year to the same place.

 town itself was small and compact with lots of shops, bars, and restaurants. We found Eric's bar and grill the most fun place to hangout after skiing/boarding. However we did run into more than a few locals that had bad attitudes towards Texans. y went as far as disrespecting our driving and tipping. For the most part we shrugged it off but were kind of taken back about how bold these people were with their comments. Just for the record not everyone in Texas drives recklessly in a huge truck and tips 5%. Anyway, overall a very fun trip.",stevenam

3079,2008-01-23,North Carolina,Cataloochee,2,"I took the kids up here this past weekend for thier first attempt at skiing. and they loved it.  hill is perfect for beginners, with the ""carpet lifts"" to start out with. It was crowded in the early afternoon when we started but quickly cleared after the 4:30 day pass ran out. We had arrived from atlanta around 1:30 pm (3 hour trip) and it seemed sensible to get the twilight pass so the kids would have more time on the slopes if they liked it. If you go here with beginners walk to the right hand side its a better hill then the one on the left (more room and longer ""run""). Once they got the hang of it, and were in control and making turns we tried the triple lift on that side.  operators slowed the lift for us and we got on and had some fun runs.
It was definitely worth the trip from atlanta and we are certainly going to return. 
   kids enjoyed skiing so much that when we went to Tube world the next day they were like I want to go skiing. Thats not to bad mouth Tube World because we did have fun, its just Skiing is so much fun. Another quick word about Tube World is they have set times ever two hours starting at 10 am so if you arrive at 10:30 your off the sled hill with everyone that started at 10, so you kind of short change yourself.  
 I quick word about Maggie Valley. It seems its more of summer/spring  town. Alot of things were not open, and restaurants closed early on Sunday or weren't open at all. We eventually ate at Smackers which is kind of out of town, but it was good. We had breakfest at Joey's Pancake house and that was excellent.

3080,2008-01-23,North Carolina,Wolf Ridge Ski,4,"  seems to be in pretty good shape.  No difficult trails are open as of jan. 10 but are expected to open once the weather gets cooler.  Kind of crouded on the front side due to the fact that there is only that one major run were all the other runs open up to.  Other than than it being kind of crouded, its pretty good.  Most places are fast unless you hit some of the loose snow on the sides.",bodyflight
3096,2008-01-24,Wisconsin,Granite Peak,5,"I skied Granite Peak between Christmas and New Years 2007. Although the there were lift lines, they were tolderable and the comet express was excellent. I am pretty savy on Midwet Ski Resorts, what they have to offer and statistics. Think about how many Midwest Ski areas have an express lift? I can think of two others.  staff is friendly and actually much older than you would expect. Also facilities are new and fresh looking.  hill with its 650'+ verticle is nice and the runs are longer than most in the midwest. True the bottom is a little ""flat"" but this is simply a geographical feature of all hills, including mountains in skiing heaven, Colorado. GP offers a decent sized skiing area 286 acres, great verticle, and excellent variety. Spots can get pretty icy   welcome to the Midwest. Man made snow, temperatures, and snow borders cause this. GP is a great Midwest skiing haven during the week for sure. Easily top ten in the Midwest. and the price may may your heart skip 1/2 a beat, but it shouldn't. Compare what you get and the prices to other ski areas, and you'll come out ahead by skiing the new and much imroved Granite Peak.",Bartakamoose
3097,2008-01-24,Wisconsin,Mt. La Crosse,4,very icy. I was in college there and took snowboarding class.  conditions were terrible. re is no such thing as a green run there due to the constriction nature of such run. I've never seen a green with so narrow a trail. One wrong move and you're in the 'terrain park'. ,Bartakamoose
3098,2008-01-24,Wisconsin,Devils Head,4,"We just went snowboarding there this past sunday on our way to Granite's Peak, since GP closes at 4pm on Sundays.  First off they really need to put some signs up so you can find the place, we just happened to look up and see the runs or we would have drove right by the entrance.  None of our group was too impressed with the runs, very slow and not very challenging.  We would start at the top of the so called black diamonds and bomb run down only carving enough to make the turns.   2 person lifts also sucked, they could at least glue some foam down to the seats.  We are heading back up to GP in a couple of weeks starting on a sunday again but I think we will try Cascade Mountain, Devilshead is not worth a second trip.",Bartakamoose

3189,2008-01-29,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,4,"With limited choices for hundreds of miles around, Showshoe can be rewarding if you're willing to bite the bullet.  First off, it's not an easy mountain to get around, starting with the long drive through the congested village to get to the parking at the ""Top of the World.""  From there it's a narrow cat track run to the heart of the mountain.  To get to the ""Western Territory"" (2 runs, Cupp & Shays) you have to pole your way 100 feet to cross the road you drove up on, and pole some more.  But these 2 runs are worth the money, Cupp is beautifully sculpted, Lower Shays is really steep with monster moguls.  

However, Snowshoe is the reason why I avoid all Intrawest properties.  I just do not like being beholden to a megacorporation who stays competitive by eliminating options.  One experience I had was when I ordered a carryout pizza.  When I arrived it wasn't ready   in fact they didn't do carryout orders!  Indeed, I called the pizza place that was listed on the xerox sheet left in my hotel room, but for some reason their phone number had been transferred to another pizza place in a different building (yes, Intrawest also administrates the entire phone exchange).  After tracking down my pizza, I waited an excruciating 20 minutes for 3 customers to buy pizza by the slice.  Poor service isn't limited to the restaurants; the bruise left when the Widowmaker chair whacked my calf nearly ruined my trip.

Here's another example of the way the geniuses running Intrawest operate.  A few years ago there was a really bad ice storm, left about 2 feet of snow on the mountain but created a state of emergency in DC, MD, KY, and WV.  So Snowshoe runs a special 1/2 price promotion, encouraging people to drive through the storm.  Also, the directions to Snowshoe for those of us coming from the west takes an hour longer than it should    because the shorter route takes you past Canaan Valley and Timberline.  All in all, I get the feeling that management at Snowshoe puts the guest experience at a very low priority.",swetsb

This was my kind of skiing cuz the trails are quite long and they are very wide, so you can get used to the terrain and mechanics of skiing without getting in peoples way.  We were there for 3 days and it snowed two out of the three we were on the mountain.  I would highly recommend Park City Mountain Resort to everyone who loves skiing and I would definitely go back if given the chance.",thorne36
3247,2008-02-01,Oregon,Mt. Hood Meadows,4,"I visited Meadows in April and it started out blue sky and empty!. It takes no time at all from Hood River and was easy to find. All the Employees were polite and friendly which always makes a good impression. As the day progressed it became overcast and windy which got cold on Cascade Express (the top lift) so I stayed on the lower mountain. Heather Canyon was the best Bowl area I have ever gone on in my life.  afternoon was not the best, as it warmed up and the snow became extremely slow. Flat runs were almost impossible by Heather Canyon stayed awsome. By the end of the day it started to rain.
     It was spring and conditions can be changeing fast there but the tickets were not overpriced and I would recommend going there on a spring day because there were NO lift lines all day.

3248,2008-02-01,Washington,Crystal Mountain Washington,4,"Management does not demand good service from their employees. 

 I grew up in Summer, so Crystal has been my ski area for 40 years. I love skiing Crystal.  views alone are spectacular. However, I think the management of  Crystal is NOT doing a good job. For example,one of my biggest gripes is that the chair lift operators do not say hello. I know they only get minumum wage but how much do you have to pay someone to say hello? I think this is a direct result of poor management: they set the standard of poor service. Whatever the uppermanagement sets will filter down to the regular employees. If the management expected people to be friendly and welcoming they would be.    Please, management, think of great service  friendly and accomodating and not only will your staff have a better attitude but your skiing customers will be happier too.

3249,2008-02-01,Washington,Summit at Snoqualmie,4,"I have been skiing for 20 years and decided that the Summit was the place to learn how to snowboard.  ir EZ Ride 123 classes were a great deal and they offered a fantastic deal on a season's pass upon graduation.  Two out of 3 of my instructors were great, the other was worthless.  Because I completed my classes early in the season, the classes were pretty small & not too bad.  My friends had the misfortune to sign up later & class sizes were huge (18 students to 1 instructor).

For my first season, the Summit worked O.K., but I will not be going back next season.   beginner runs are O.K., and there is one blue run that is very easy.  Other than that, the next ""easiest"" blue run has a very steep section that gets littered with people that can't handle it.

 staff for the most part is very inattentive, to say the least.  y have kids working there who look about 10 years old, though word is, they are 14.  y have no customer service skills whatsoever.   lift attendants (with the exception of 2), pay very little attention to what is going on.   rental people are unknowledgeable & they frequently run out of rental gear by mid morning.

 facilities need A LOT of work!   food is horrible for the most part & way overpriced.   bathrooms stink and are always in need of restocking.

Central is the best area, and as a result is usually very crowded.  I was more impressed with the terrain than I thought I would be.  y just need to put a lot of time / money into the facilities.",Resort Travel
3292,2008-02-04,New Jersey,Mountain Creek,2,Mountain Creek Hands down is probably the worst mountain out there. Don't go there expecting nice groomed trails. Be prepared to be blown away by how horrible job they do grooming. ICE! ICE! ICE! I can not say more. I can go on forever about how bad it is. I suggest spending the extra money and time to go to Vermont and have a more enjoyable time skiing.   ,CopPsychDoc
3293,2008-02-04,New York,Belleayre,5,"I was bringing my 6 year old to learn to ski.  first time I went, I chose Belleayre simply because a friend has a house nearby. I was more than pleasantly surprised. My daughter started riding the lift fairly quickly, so the size of the discovery area is actually a big bonus. at some of the other local mountains, she would have had significantly less beginner terrain on which to ski. I wish that one of the lifts was configured more for shorter kids like I have seen elsewhere.

As for the top, as a boarder, I didn't really appreciate the long skate to get from the hi speed quad to the blues, but it's worth it (and I'm much better on one foot now). Plus, I like the variety of terrain which includes cruisers as well as steeps with and without bumps. 

It's not as crowded as either Hunter or Windham, offers better boarder terrain than Hunter, and better intermediate terrain than Windham. It's not as refined as the only slightly bigger private areas, but it is priced very competitively and the actual snow experience is at least as good.

Yes   it is a smaller mountain with shorter trails, but it is perfect for the kids and family.  My daughter, who is now six learned to ski there last year and my son, who is three and half is learning this year.   whole setting is very intimate that the kids are not overwhelmed.   snow making is quite impressive as well.  Even after the warm weather and rain, the place somehow always managed to have decent amount of snow on the ground.   staff is usually very friendly and polite.

Compared to other s the place is empty and the people are friendly.   ski weeks are also amazing.  I have been there 6 times and every time a took an expert lesson.   ski school is phenominal!!!  I don't take lessons anywhere else but this place is known for their ski weeks no matter what level of skier you are.   nightlife can be fun too even though this place is not geared toward the party all night type but rather the hard core skiier.   hotel St. Benard is a great place for happy hour after skiing and at night they typically have a band.

  A nice local area with a lot of terrain and vertical drop, as well as some of the best tree skiing around.  Seriously.  
  Two major storm tracks affect the area from the Pacific and unfortunately for the Bowl the storms mostly go south to the Bitterroot range or north to the Glacier park area.  
  Also unfortunately the majority of the mountain and all of the black runs face either due south or southwest (worst).  Especially in the beginning and ending of season the snow can be AWFUL.  (But with this said the snow can also be GREAT at anytime)

If it snows in Stowe you can guarantee that there is no better tree skiing in the east. Lifts can get a bit long sometimes and if you aren't willing to hike above the gondola on that part of the mountain, you wont find too much challenging terrain aside from off of Mansfield. However, the front four Starr, Goat, Liftline and National will NOT be dissapointing especially on a powder day.  terrain park has a bit to be desired, considering it lacks rails and the Tyro park and Standard park have been moved over to Spruce peak where there is no challenge whatsoever. I have heard people say that the staff at Stowe have no personality and are not friendly, but for four or five years now, I have had no problems with them, and they were extremely helpful in the main lodge at mansfield. That being said, the lodge at mansfield is TINY for the number of people in it during holiday periods, and yes lift tickets are more expensive. In my opinion, Stowe is a great place for a day trip OR a week of skiing and if you go in mid winter you are sure to have a powder day at least 3 days out of the week.

This season we have had the best, absolutely best days of skiing at Stratton.   natural snow is awesome. Grooming is great.  Snowmaking is amazing.  Also we have had some of the worst days.  With global warming, Vermont has had frozen rain a number of times.  Too many times.

Strattons double blacks are really bumped up blacks.  This season they have been groomed most of the time, to turn the ice crust to frozen granular, and have become blacks.  and Stratton just does not have the terrain that Sugarbush does.  Stratton is a round top mountain, just like Okemo, Bromley and Mt. Snow, all Southern Vermont Mountains.

Most of the Stratton condos are located on the shuttle route.  y are generally nice and great family places.   slopeside condos at the Stratton village are expensive, but then you can walk to everything.  Some of them are perfect for a family vacation.

To avoid crowds on Saturday, start early, take a few Bear runs on Ursa, then at 10:30 ski Kitterbrook runs or Upper Middlebrook to the Shooting Star lift.  An alternative is to ski the Snowbowl runs, Liftline is our favorite, to the Snowbowl lift.  It is a regular speed lift, but by now we need a break, and have lunch from 11:30 to 12:00.

We have friends who ski Okemo on Saturday and think they do a better job with the peak 10:45 to 11:30 crowds and like Saphire and the Stump runs.  y ski Stratton on Sunday and when it is cold on Saturday.  y think Stratton has better grooming and there is the gondola.  y have season, non holiday passes that work on both mountains.

So Stratton is great for families, no crowds at all mid week, great terrain parks and snowboarding.  It does not have all the access road night life Killington does, the large Vermont village Stowe does, the total young family dedication Smugglers does.  

When I am at Copper or Mamoth and in the giant bowls and piles of powder I can not handle, I think sometimes I prefer the groomed Stratton.  It is like the lower half of these mountains.  But then I am retired, getting old, and have broken more bones than I can count (most of them not skiing.

3539,2008-02-20,Colorado,Telluride,4,"I'm 47 years old and I've been skiing since I was 12 and Telluride is the most beautiful place that I've ever been skiing... 

We skied from February 6 through the 10.   snow was absolutely perfect and we never experienced a line to the lifts the whole time we were there...  

 Gondola was the greatest thing to visit the town of Telluride from Mountain Village.  Everything was in walking distance...  This was the absolute best skiing experience in my life.

3549,2008-02-20,Pennsylvania,Camelback Mountain,4,"  My family and I went to Camelback 2 years ago, it was ok for where it
is located. You have to realize this is east coast skiinig in the poconos
and you can't expect but so much.
   I have skied in Vermont, Colorado and LAke Tahoe and Snowshoe,W.Va.
along with Switzerland and you cannot compare Camelback to those s.
I will admit there is not much snow to speak of, butwe were prepared for
that. Yes, the food is pricey and the staff is not the best i have seen
at ski s. I would ski Camelback if i lived within 100 miles.
I read reviews on these s a lot and i find it amazing at the negative comments on this , but give the place a little slack and 
ski Colorado or Vermont if you are a diehard boarder or skier.",soakandski

the bathrooms were disgusting and toilets did not work.  dining room does not have enough seating. food is overpriced and tasteless with no healthy options.
we went into town and had sanwiches made and stored them in a locker. Not only much cheaper but healthier. also they do not want you bringing your own lunch inside till after 2:00. what a joke.

I live in ohio, so it's close, and it's bigger than ohio s. I found snowshoe trying to find another ski  that i liked so I could have options, and now it has become a yearly trip as well. While 7 springs is a little easier to maneuver around, the crowds are just as bad, and the last two years there hasn't been good conditions when I've gone. Since I have to book a trip way in advance I have no way to control the weather for that weekend, but Snowshoe has consistently had plenty of snow every time we get rain.  village is very nicely setup, there's a nice selection of ""real"" food, which you don't necessarily get at 7 springs unless you're willing to pay around $30.(can only eat pizza and nachos so many times, lol.)

3636,2008-02-25,California,Mammoth Mountain,3,"mammoth can be great but usally you are going to get fierce winds,very cold and long lines. y might have great advanced runs but after a hour they turn in to crud. Powder days arent as good as lets say Sierra Summit or Northstar. I used to think that mammoths park was big but to tell you the truth its not that big. To me its not worth the drive!!!!!!!!!!!",thereporter
3637,2008-02-25,California,Ski China Peak,5,"Well, a few below this I noticed someone stating how we have such easy terrain with no double diamonds and short runs.  Our park happens to be just as good as some of the top parks in California, just in smaller moderation.  We don't have a high speed lift but, short lines make up for that time.  re has never been a day, even in peak season when I waited more than 5 minutes for any chair on the mountain.  I can stand for fifteen minutes up in Tahoe at some s or I can ride an equal length chair for 10 minutes and wait in almost no lift line.  Our terrain is just as hard as some of the hardest places in the world, you just have to know where to access it.  If you have skied some of the most technical lines at Squaw or Mammoth, you should try the false peak, it's the giant looking peak when you get off of chair one.  I can hike 30 seconds and get double diamond terrain without a name and it's in boundaries.  re are multiple sections of the Face.  Our mountains most famous steep run, Avalanche and Juniper are the two runs on the right and left side.  Juniper provides for excellent open bowl powder that takes forever to get tracked out.  Avalanche doesn't get tracked out fast either and is a big mountain skiers dream.  You can kick it off by jumping off the 40 foot cliff up top then hitting the large choice of ten to 25 foot drops and chutes below or ski around the top cliff and hit the lower chutes and drops.  re are over 100 different options on this run.  Buckhorn provides as the mountain's only named double diamond it is steep in short increments and is over a mile long.  the bottom is fun as you weave your way through boulders and step down drops then you skate out for a great length so when the run turns left, pick up speed and carry your momentum through the smaller upper trail out.  It's hard to spot but off to the right it's a wide trail, you need to look straight ahead and you will get to the cat track.  Powder takes forever to get tracked out as long as you go to the right places, if you want to ski in the chair one area, that will be tracked out before you can yell POWDER DAY!  same with Waterfall.  Take chair five to east bowl and that gets track out fast too, but it's awesome.  Westridge has lovely kicker filled glades.  In the trees between lower dynamite and buckhorn is the best stash on earth, try not to tell too many people.   park is awesome and easy to lap.  So what if we don't have a halfpipe?  we have an awesome park, we inherit all of bear mt.n. and snow summit's top of the line Snow Park Tech features.   food sucks but you're welcome to setup your own little lunch at their provided picnic tables.  Groomers are excelent, they keep them in good shape but just watch out for icy runs such as mainstream, chair two is the best for groomers.  What we have is real skiing.",thereporter
3638,2008-02-25,Utah,Wolf Creek,3,I had an afternoon/evening to kill since my flight got me into SLC just after noon and it took me until around 2 to navigate route 39 to Eden but this was the perfect place to do it especially since the entire area is open until 10PM.   valley doesn't offer much in the way of nightlife but I've alwyas thought that if you're on a ski vacation you should ski not sit around talking about it over drinks.   trails are not particularly steep nor long but they are an excellent way to warm up for the bigger ski areas in the valley (Powder and Snowbasin) and they have the same abundance of powder on them.   best thing was that a ski pass cost me about what lunch at one of the Park City tourist traps costs ($20   $23) so you can't beat the value.   people were extremely friendly and the lines were moderate but moved quickly.

Watch the ice though   it doesn't have the reputation as being ""iceface"" for nothing.  However, I have found most of the ice is on the steeps or near the snowmaking devices.

3669,2008-02-27,Vermont,Killington,4,"I have been coming to Killington since 1978.  Over the years I saw a lot of terrain added and saw a lot of improvements to the lodges and bar lounges, learning areas, terrain parks, lifts, etc. Everything is in place to make this a great .  This year, I have seen trails closed for no reason (plenty of cover), food courts and cocktail lounges closed during the week at Bear Mt. and K1, ticket booths closed, less staff, etc.  I see on their web site today (2/26)that Lower Great Eastern is closed, along with Stage 1 of the Skyship, eliminating one of the most enjoyable long runs the place has to offer, and I notice that  ENTIRE PICO MOUNTAIN is CLOSED!  All this in February with a good amount of snow falling from the sky!

3670,2008-02-27,California,Sugar Bowl,5,"Sugar Bowl is my favorite in the Tahoe area, and I've skied at most of them now. I've never had a bad time there. I've only been once in the 07/08 season, and that was before there was much snow, but still it was a lovely day. 

I usually hit Sugar Bowl for day trips and hit other s for overnights. I live in the Bay Area, and Sugar Bowl is the easiest drive for me. In good weather and minimal traffic, I can be from San Mateo to Sugar Bowl's parking lot in right about 3 hours. You have to get up early in the morning to beat the traffic, though. Load up your gear the night before and put your coffee pot on timer. n grab your coffee and get out the door at 5:30. You'll be there when the lifts open.

 staff at Sugar Bowl are friendly and efficient. On weekends they have traffic managers at the busier lifts to keep things moving smoothly. Most of the lifts are of the modern, high speed variety and are easy to get on and easy to exit. 

 main reason I love Sugar Bowl is the terrain. y have lots of great stuff for intermediates like me. y have plenty of advanced and beginner, too. It's great for families/groups of mixed abilities. ",belindajk
3671,2008-02-27,California,Kirkwood,4,"Husband and I rented a condo there for Sunday and Monday night and had a lovely time. All the staff we met were friendly and nice.  mid week ski and stay is a great deal. We got 2 2 day lift tickets and 2 nights in a charming little fully furnished condo (with full kitchen, etc) for just about $400   including taxes and fees. You can hardly beat that anywhere in Tahoe. 

Food prices at concessioners were similar to any other  in Tahoe, which is to say, rather pricy. No surprise there. We mostly cooked in our kitchen, but we did have a hotdog one day at the village's hotdog stand and it was overpriced but delicious. at same stand, you can get 24 ounce beers at $8 a can for a good beer or $5 a can for a Coors Light. 

It was more crowded than we anticipated on a Monday/Tuesday, but still not bad at all. We never waited in a lift line longer than about 5 minutes.  other skiers and boarders we met were nice and we didn't encounter any rudeness. re was minimal ""out of control"" skiing and riding going on, so I give the clientelle a big thumbs up.

Kirkwood is a favorite of expert skiers/riders, and I can see why. re is a lot of black and double black terrain. My husband and I weren't quite up to most of it. We can do single black providing the snow is soft but most of the single blacks were choppy and/or covered with killer moguls, even though a big storm dumped many inches of fresh the night before we arrived. So we were kind of limited in how much of the mountain we could see. We took one lift to the top so we could see it. We took Cornice up and skied down Olympic. It was super challenging for us as intermediate skiers. We got down it fine and unharmed and enjoyed ourselves doing it, but it's not the kind of skiing we can just do all day. re were enough intermediate runs to keep us busy for the rest of our 2 day Kirkwood experience, but we had skied them all at least once or twice by the end of the 2 day. 

So if you're a great skier/rider who loves steeps, moguls, and double blacks of all kinds, I think you will have a great time here. If you're an intermediate or beginning skier, you can have a good day here, but you might enjoy somewhere like Sierra at Tahoe (for the south shore) or Sugar Bowl (for the north shore) a little better. re they have that small  feeling like Kirkwood but with more terrain available for intermediates.

3709,2008-02-29,New York,Whiteface Mountain,5,"Fantatic destination.  Four of us spent three nights/two days skiing the weekend after President's Day.   mountain is huge, and that can't be overstated.  By comparison, I skiied all day for two days at Snowshoe and never felt tired, while I was wiped after a couple of hours on the first day at Whiteface.  Skiing from the summit to the base is a 20 30 minute trip, depending on how often you stop.  Literally did not wait longer than 1 minute at any lift at any point over two days.  Great variety of trails, although the greens are all segregated from the rest of the mountain (with one exception).
Conditions were pretty good.  Got a couple of inches on our first day that generated some good bumps.   second day was a warmer and sunny.  Some icy spots, especially on the lower third of the mountain where there were more people, but we are on the East Coast.
Lake Placid was fun (no more than 10 minutes to the mountain).  Long single street with bars, restaurants, and shops.  Many different options for food and atmosphere, although most of the tourists were back in their hotels by 10 pm.  I'd recommend staying here as there's lots to do and there is no lodging on the mountain.
  itself is nothing special.   drop off area was crowded and the closer parking lots were $12 20, although there was a shuttle to the farthest parking lot.  Workers were generally pleasant, although the rental area was not tightly run even though it wasn't very busy.  ate at the food shack at mid mountain; if you want warm food and a drink, it'll cost at least $10.  Nice area to sit outside overlooking the lower half of the mountain, including a fire pit. 
I would highly recommend Whiteface as a skiing destination.  Great skiing on a huge mountain with lots to do after.",mt.bporru

We had beautiful weather the entire week, all you needed to ski in was a t shirt. re was plenty of snow on the mountain and it was well groomed.  prices at Heavenly are a little higher than some of the other s, but the views are spectacular! However, I would not suggest going on the weekend, it is extremely crowded! You don't have to wait too long for lifts since they are high speed, but there are just so many people you have to maneuver around. It seems like the California side of the mountain was more crowded, so taking the time to trek over to the Nevada side would help cut down on the crowds.  runs were a lot of fun, challenging and well groomed. I am intermediate to advanced, my husband is advanced, and we found it to be challenging and fun.  food on the mountain isn't great, but I have yet to experience a mountain top restaurant that was. It's an enormous amount of food that you get, so we were wishing we had shared something.  contrast in views from the California side to the Nevada side are amazingly different.

3739,2008-03-03,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,5,"I just skied Snowshoe on Thur & Fri, Feb 28 & 29. Drove 10 1/2 hours from St. Louis area (400 miles closer than Colorado & 1500 vertical sounded better than 500 in midwest) I've been curious to try Snowshoe for years. I read all the reviews here about the area & was thinking it would be a so so trip. I read complaints about rude & poor staff & poor food, etc. I found all the employees, from check in to ski rental to waiters, and even the dreaded lift ops to be very friendly & helpful. One review even complains about sore calves all week because the lift ops let the chairs hit them in the legs. Well, for heavens sake, learn to sit early or put your hand down & catch the chair!! I'm used to skiing in the west, and Snowshoe can't stand up to the big s out there, but I think it is a solid area, and I enjoyed my time there.  runs on the back side (Cupp & Shays) offer up solid vertical, and even though they would be blue runs out west, they are very good cruisers to gobble up lots of vertical feet on. With the express chair & most people staying on the front side, I could get 12,000 vert before early lunch! Thursday, all day, there was snowmaking on several slopes, which gives you face shots of a negative kind, but I understand the need to get the most snow made whenever possible.  front side has some nice runs also even tho the vertical is about 1/2. I read complaints about narrow runs. I love narrow runs, they have much more character. re were only a few runs like that, & if you feel more comfortable on wider runs, there are plenty of those also.  crowds weren't bad, altho I can see nightmare crowds on busy weekends, and there aren't enough services to support huge crowds!  on mt. dining spots are tiny & there is probably not enough dining in the village then either. One problem that I see is that the ownership need to back off of more lodging & add more services & runs on the mountain to spread out the crowds. If Lower Shays is too steep to hold snow, grade it down where it can. Add a couple more options on the back side with Cupp & Shays. re is room for several runs & a couple more lifts on the front side also. Quit building lodging, you're already maxed out in that dept. Build on your mountain, it has a lot of potential!! I ate dinner at Ember & Foxfire Grille and loved them both! Great food & service, and the price was reasonable. Over all, I enjoyed my trip, and even tho I don't take short trips like this very often, I would come here again. ONLY MIDWEEK tho!!     ",Americansonofa

We're used to skiing out west (Aspen and Steamboat Springs) so all I would say is that Windham was better than we expected and you can have a lot of fun if you keep in mind that the kids are getting practice. It's good for them to learn how to handle some ice, right? I don't mean to be negative or snooty, we really had a good time.
  only bummer was that my eight year old was involved in a hit and run with a boarder. She was shook up enough to go to the first aid station. This all happened near the bottom of the mountain at the end of the day on Sunday.  staff was excellent but all sort of rolled their eyes and said ""oh yeah, people go way too fast."" Part of the problem is that there are no ""slow"" signs and nobody keeping an eye out for jerks mowing down kids on the crowded lower parts. One person in the first aid area said that there were only three ski patrol on the whole mountain. Don't know if that's true but I didn't see anybody trying to do anything about the speed. I expect to see people bombing around on the upper trails but the lack of traffic management down towards the bottom is a hazard that the mountain should do something about.",mt.bporru
3932,2008-03-18,Michigan,Nubs Nob,4,"    We skied last Saturday and Sunday with the little kids, 3 and 6.  snow was great mid winter groomed powder, with clear blue skies, and a pleasant 25 degrees with sunshine.  older kid skied the whole area and the 3 year old stayed on the purple chair. Sunday was even better with fewer people and just as nice a snow. If you like the groomers, this is the place as the snow is impeccably groomed twice a day, or more. If you want to teach a family member or friend to ski, the ski school is great and the purple chair is free. Go to Nub's and have fun. ",nzh0tg
3940,2008-03-19,California,Northstar California,5,"Northstar is one of the best ski s in Tahoe.   backside has plenty of challenging blacks, while the frontside is well protected from the wind.  While other s might be on wind hold, Northstar will continue to run during bad weather.

3982,2008-03-23,Pennsylvania,Elk Mountain Ski,2,"We drove into town Feb 29   it was snowing which really got us in the mood for skiing.  We hit the slopes the following morning (Saturday, March 1) and it was great.  In the morning there were no lift lines to speak of.  We waited no more than 60 seconds to get on a lift up until almost lunch time.   snow was excellent and the trails are exciting.  Our only ski experiences prior to Elk have been at Roundtop.  Roundtop is fine but the Elk experience is much more fun.   night skiing was not the best because there are only a few slopes open, but who cares   the day skiing was great!   lodge is OK, nothing special.   food, while not spectacular, was reasonably priced.   ski shop prices were fair   I bought the wife a pair of Oakley goggles for 39 bucks.  We stayed at the Wiffy Bog and highly recommend staying there.  Accommodations were very comfortable and the breakfast was great.  Do you self a favor and check out Elk Mountain and the Wiffy Bog!

3996,2008-03-24,New Hampshire,Attitash,5,"I don't understand the user's awful review from 3/3 at all...We have been Attitash passholders (ASC before this year) for the past 5 years now.  I've been skiing there for fifteen years overall.  I cannot get over how friendly and welcoming the staff is here!  From the parking lot folks, to the ski and bag check to the (majority of) lift operators and ski patrol.  I give them an A+ for customer service!  Sure, the lift ticket pricing is pretty high, but it's like that at almost EVERY mountain these days...that is one of the major reasons we opt to buy the pass.

Apres ski is pretty good too, although we did encounter a cranky waitress this past Saturday...I guess you can't be spot on 100% of the time.

We especially like Attitash because we can go there with skiers of various levels and still stick together for most of the day (mixing it up with a detour here and there and then meeting up again at a trail merge so everyone is still skiing within their ability).

One thing on my wish list though...put in a high speed quad up to the summit on Attitash (pretty please!!!)  :)",Jay C

4039,2008-03-28,Wyoming,Snowy Range,3,"Not wanting to sit in traffic for hours on I 70 myself and a buddy of mine decided to drive up to Snowy Range from Denver. We both had never skied there before so we were looking forward to see what we would find. What we found was 250 acres and 27 trails of all types and challenges and a really good day of skiing. re are no high speed lifts, and on this day they only ran 2 of their 5 lifts, 1 on the front side of the mountain and another on the back side. Ok, 3 lifts if you want to count the magic carpet for the kids. If you like to ride as much as possible and not wait in long lift lines then this is a really good choice. Every time we got in a lift line our ""wait"" was never a wait at all. 

 drive from Denver is 150 miles, give or take and an easy drive to make. We were on the mountain just after 10 and back in Denver before 6, having left Snowy Range at 3pm. 

Snowy Range is small, but offers alot. Parking is free. Tickets for adults are $41, cash, check or credit card. Yes they do take checks.  day lodge is huge, the ticket windows, restrooms, gift shop and rentals are on the bottom floor and the food can be found on the upper floor. y offer a decent and varied food selection. and the upper floor seats 850 people, there are tvs to watch sports on and plenty of windows on which to look out at the activity on the mountain.  ski school is in a separate building and the ski patrol in another building. One thing you will notice is the ski patrol are all over the mountain, at the top of each ski lift as well as throughout the trails. So they are never too far away should they be needed. We did see some rails, boxes and jumps in some of the terrain park riding up the lift, but how much there is to ride and do tricks on I dont know. So I rated it average.

If you want an easy drive on the interstate without the hassles of traffic jams and are into skiing for the sure enjoyment of it no matter the destination, give Snowy Range a try. I will certainly be back.",Philip H. Eckerberg
4042,2008-03-29,Wisconsin,Devils Head,3," year has been great for snow, especially at DH.   y need to keep it up though once the season starts.  After the hill fills with snow it seems all they care about is grooming at 5pm, but yet not in the Terrain park.  All sorts of areas could be deemed tree skiing and yet you only get yelled at by Ski Patrol for going in them.  y did not change the park ONE time this year. Huge dissappointment!  Shaping the pipe once a month is no good as well.  DH needs to care more about the customers that go there.  We love DH and go there for all the right reasons and the right reasons this year have faded to a dull grey.",Adye 1
4055,2008-03-30,New York,Hunter Mountain,2,"Skied Hunter on Sat. 3/22/08.  Tried the whole mountain, except the West side.
 snow conditions were horrible...all hard ice with loose frozen granular. Even when it warmed up in the pm, the granular just became a bit slushy, but never had the feeling of snow.  We were just scrapping on ice all day.
Lots of out of control boarders and skiiers made it dangerous with those conditions.

Our day at Powder Mountain was memorable for many reasons but for a skier who began in Vermont in the 70's Powder was a trip down memory lane. Ski bags in the base lodge, not a sprout in site at lunch and nobody carrying your skis from your car. I'm not suggesting the slope conditions were Vermont like, the conditions were just what you expect from Utah, wonderful. Quite runs with few skiers made for a great time.

4259,2008-08-27,California,Palisades Tahoe,5,"As a member of the armed forces, I am truly greatful for the many great times I've had at Squaw, because of their military appreciation rates. I've taken advantage of the free lift tickets, and discounts on rentals on many occasions. As you may know, we don't get paid a lot, and skiing is a luxury we can't always afford. But Squaw has extended their generosity to us, and it is greatly appreciated. Corporate America does not seem to give a damn about us, but here is one rare instance where somebody is doing the right thing. Squaw should be comended for it. Other s offer a pitiful, small discount, and make getting the discount difficult (you have to purchase the tickets at very specific, out of the way military locations).....but Squaw has made the process easy, and it's 100% free. Unbelievable. Thank you very much. Also, the mountain rocks, and the terrain and snow are amazing. So even if you're not military, you will enjoy this place. Squaw is definitely one of the best mountains in North America, and ranks in the top 3 in Tahoe.....in my humble opinion. ",John Gonzalez

4270,2008-09-01,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,4,"Just a correction to an earlier post about A Basin being part of Vail Resorts   it is not.  A Basin and Vail Resorts have a ticket/pass sharing arrangement only   and typically only one way.  That is, your lift ticket from a Vail Resort's property will work at A Basin (usually) but not the other way around.

As for the lift ticket prices in early or late season when there are fewer runs open, well there are still costs to start things up and keep things going.  However, there are ways to minimize one's lift ticket prices by buying them anywhere else but the window.  Local supermarkets and other outlets will sell lift tickets at a discount (at least here in Denver   have not checked in Summit County to see if the same discount holds true there) and often there are coupons available as well (Entertainment books, etc.).  Also, if you were to come with 3 of your friends in the same car to the Basin you'd score a $41.00 lift ticket over the normal price of $58.00.

That said, there are few places you can ski a powder day in May   A Basin is one of those places : ) In addition, my children have gone to several ski schools and they have consistently reported they enjoy the instructors at A Basin over those they have had at other s.  and, there are few mountains where you can go from what seems like a simple line to ""where do I go from here"" in a heartbeat.  To all of you who have come down Leenawee and dropped into Falcon carrying some speed can attest : )

As far as ""Apres"" skiing, well, I've seen quite a bit at "" Beach"" at A Basin, but what better way to relax than having your own portable hot tub sitting not 100 yards from the nearest lift?  It is what you make it and at A Basin you can do things ""they"" won't let you do anywhere else.  That is what makes it special   along with the great skiing, scenery, and snow...  Enjoy.",joe castelli
4271,2008-09-02,Indiana,Paoli Peaks,3,"Brought my family here to learn to ski in preparation for a trip out west later in the spring.  This enabled us to make the most of our trip out there   a really good idea and worth every penny.  It was my first time to ski since being a teenager.  We didn't have any trouble finding our way around and access to slopes from the lodge/ski rental area was easy.  Weird set up with the lodge at the top of the hill.  Lodging in the area is fairly expensive for what you get.  Shopping is as good as the local walmart.  

My wife and I took a beginners lesson. I couldn't believe how quickly it all came back to me.  My wife picked up on things really quick as well and by the end of the afternoon, we were having a great time.  Our instructor was a really nice guy, obviously there for weekend kicks to share his love for the sport with others.  My kids (9 and 6) had a good first time on skis too.  ir instruction was mediocre, but at least an introduction.  

After our lesson we had a great time as a family on the bunny slopes.  It was fairly crowded, but we never waited at the lift.  We skiied to the bottom of the hill a couple of times, but it was a little tough for the newbies, so we stayed mostly on the very short bunny hiil at the top.  I took a couple of quick runs on the only advanced slope   it was pretty icey (but earlier in the week it had been in the 70s).   drop is short, but it was still fun for a quick fix.  I would rate it similar to a medium to difficult intermidiate slope at a western .

Rental place was OK.  If you were a complete novice, you might be in trouble as there was not a lot of instruction on how to pick proper boots.  Had a little trouble with my 9 year old's binding popping loose that afternoon.  Took it in to the rental place in the lodge and they fixed it right up.  Fortunately, she hadn't been skiing fast enough to hurt herself.

This place is as fun as you make it.  If you are expecting a good introduction or an opportunity to steal a few turns for a tune up, this is as good a place as any within 4 hours of nashville.  If you have delusions of grandeur, a great alpine escape on uncrowded powder laden slopes, you will be disappointed.

Watch the conditions here closely.  Before we came, the temps were in the 70's (very strange for jan).  I was concerned there would be no snow, but the temp dropped, they blew some snow out, and by saturday morning, the bunny slope was passable.  Unbelievable!  second day a little snowstorm blew through, the kids thought it was heaven.  My little one on the lift up for our last run confided: ""Daddy, this is better than Disneyworld!""  Some of the best words I ever heard.

4272,2008-09-02,Indiana,Paoli Peaks,3,"okay, first of all don't get me wrong, I love snowshoe, I've already been for a week this year and it was great we even got a foot of powder while I was there. But for a lot of people snowshoe is a good ways up there, where as perfect north and paoli are very close for the lower southern states. That is for sure. and as for the person who said that you'll do nothing but wait in lines at paoli, well then they haven't been there, that or they haven't been to to snowshoe either.  lines for snowshoe are ridiculous, I've sat in front of the two lifts in front of the boathouse for hours. Honestly, especially if your a boarder you might as well spend all your time at silvercreek and not snowshoe. Silvercreek is much more boarder friendly. As for the Indiana s. I would probably make the extra 2 hr drive to perfect north if I had the spare time. I have always has had a pretty good experience there and even though rentals and tickets are more, hotel stays around there can be found for much cheaper than paoli.

4279,2008-09-15,Vermont,Killington,3,"Have been going to Killington since 1996 and have loved it!!  We usually take a 2 week vacation there each winter and stay in one of the Killington Condominiums at Fall Line.  Called to make reservations this year and found that there were a lot of changes   our accommodations were priced $700 higher than last year and no one could tell me why!  I asked if there had been improvements to the unit   we always select the same one each year   as I didn't mind paying if there had been some improvements, but no one could answer that question.  lift tickets were higher and the discounted multi day tickets we usually got each year were not available like in previous years.

We started reading the reviews and checking the trail/lift report each day and found that we were going to be limited to certain parts of the mountain, certain lifts, fewer services and higher prices, not to mention the higher price of gas, which isn't the new owner's fault, but it all added up for us as we travel over 500 miles to get to Killington.

Guess what?  We didn't go!!  Sure we missed the Killington  that we once favored, we missed our favorite dining places such as the Wobbly Barn, Outback Pizza and Lookout Tavern and we missed the cozy condo at Fall Line, but we are smart enough not to be taken for a ride!

4282,2008-09-16,Minnesota,Lutsen Mountains,5,"What the weather service said was going to be a bad day on the slopes, turned out to be amazing.  Rain and wind were projected, and neither surfaced at Lutsen today.   sun managed to poke through and turned Lutsen's hills into a spring time haven for fantastic turns.

Nearly every aspect of Lusten's terrain is open.  With the exception of a few glades that are closed because of lack of coverage, everything else is well covered and well groomed.  and when all the lifts are turning at Lutsen, you won't have to stand in line too terribly long to reap the benefits either.

We started the day early, before there was any sun on anything.  It had sprinkled rain early in the morning, and the weather was dark and overcast.  We hopped the gondola to check out Moose Mountain.  When we clicked in at the top of Bull Run, the snow was hard and marbly, and rutted out from the people who were there the mere 30 minutes since  opening before us.  We decided to push over towards Wolf chair to see if maybe there was anything else in good shape.  We were surprised to find a lot of the connecting runs around the Caribou chair in better shape.  We lapped a few here, and then went for the long run under the Wolf chair and made some big, arcing turns for about 45 minutes.  n we traversed back over to Bull Run, watched a buddy rip the hardened mogul run in front of the new chalet, and then traversed back to Eagle chair.

Once we got to Eagle chair, we found Bridge run to be in the best shape.  Soft, coarse snow, perfect for making turns on.  On top of that, there were plenty of small rollers and natural jumps along the run, so we were hopping around and enjoying the day.  We lapped Bridge run a few times and then went to get some lunch.

After lunch, the sun had peaked out and was warming up the day.  We wanted to try Mystery Mountain and see if there was anything exciting there and took the chair up past the park and went into Dan's dive.  As it turns out, fat twin tips don't go very fast in the new snow conditions that awaited us: pure mashed potatoes.  My skis woefully tried to push through the soft, slushy snow.  Since the latter half of Mystery (to skier's right of the terrain park, that is) is mostly flat, I was pushing my skis every so slowly down the run.  We hoofed it back to Eagle chair, and then started lapping Koo Koo off of Eagle Mountain.  Here, the soft, super glue sticky snow didn't matter because the run was steep enough to get speed.

We arched some giant turns on Upper & Lower Koo Koo for a few runs and then headed back over to Bridge Run to check it out again with the new snow conditions.  at the top of the Eagle chair, Lutsen has a up down fat rail, and some sort of ribbed, black plastic piping with a step up on it.  We weren't entirely sure what this ribbed plastic piping was (probably for snowboards to ride), so we just cut 90 degrees across it and jumped the pipe before heading the rest of the way down Bridge.  Unfortunately, Bridge wasn't steep enough for fat twin tip skis to maintain any sort of speed, so we finished the day on the ultra soft snow of Upper and Lower Koo Koo.

Lutsen had all the chairs running today.  This was a surprise for me, since the  wasn't very busy at all (probably the weather was a factor in limiting peoples' time on the slopes).  But because they ran all the chairs, there was only a one  or two person wait to get a chair.  It was nice, and helped us get more laps out of the day.  With the weather cooperating, and the snow in terrific shape, we had a strong day skiing.

Lutsen's staff is seemingly growing friendlier (to us) at least.  It seems to me that just last season, I was posting on this site about how the Lutsen lifties constantly cast dirty looks at us for skiing ""those trick skis,"" or even non race skis.  Now, we don't feel ostracized in the least bit.  Perhaps the staff has accepted this is the 21 century, and this is how skiing is going to be like for the future.  Or perhaps they're drunk.  Either way, it was great to see constant smiles on the lifties, a friendly ""howdja do?,"" and a prompt chair under your ass.

Lutsen  this season alone  has propelled itself to my #1  in the Midwest (besides Mt. Bohemia, which is in a category of it's own).  I have a season pass for Spirit Mountain (my home mountain) and Giant's Ridge, in addition to Lutsen, but I've been to Lutsen more than any of those places this year.  By improving their grooming and their lift operations, they've cleaned up their act and started acting like a  that really WANTS to have people travel and visit it...and have fun no matter what ability.  Secondly, by having a staff that is more acceptive of  Way Skiing Was and, now,  Way Skiing Is, they've opened themselves up to a new generation (a terrain park, however poor it is this year, helps as well).   future only holds better things for this .

To digress this review even further, I would like to present a small ""Lutsen Wish List.""  First, if the rumors are true about a high speed quad to replace the Eagle chair, please let this happen.  When the skiers are pushed off Moose and don't want to take the gondola, they traverse out on Moose Return.  Help alleviate this pinch point and throw in a quad.  Additionally, some of the best runs (Hari Kari, Koo Koos, Chris' Colouir) are on Eagle.  Give the patrons of this mountain a quicker response time to the top.  Second, I see all this glading going on in the trees...under the Caribou chair, over on Eagle...if you are planning on opening up some glade skiing, let this happen next.  People can come for the groomers, but let those of us who want to get ""off piste"" at Lusten have their dues.  Third, lower the price of beer at Papa Charlie's.  I mean, seriously...it's Coors Light, not Dom.

Returning from my digression, let me wrap by saying today was a very good day.   weather broke and was warm, the crowds were minimal, and the snow was your typical spring snow.  Bring a good pair of carving sticks to Lutsen over the next week (only one week left before closing weekend!   13!) and slay some corn snow.",skylolow
4288,2008-09-22,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"My family skiied here for our first trip out west.  I had skiied out west (snowmass, bever creek, vail) as a kid and teenager, but then didn't have a chance to go for many (over 15) years until this year.  Prior to our trip, my wife and kids (2 girls under ten) learned to ski on a local hill in preparation for our colorado vacation.  This was really helpful, and worth the trouble as they all had an idea of what to expect when we got there.

Of course, the really shockng thing about breck is its size and the views are breathtaking (not to mention the altitude).  After skiing on a hill with 60 acres and a 400 ft vertical, moving to Breck was like culture shock!   but definitely in a good way.   kids loved ski school and couldn't wait to show us parts of the mountain that their instructor had showed them.  re is a ton of skiing here for beginners and intermediates, and most of the peaks are accessible to a skiier who can handle wide open, fairly gentle intermediate slopes.  One day I skiied with my teenage nephew, and we found a ton of groomed advanced trails that were nice and challenging, but not scary steep with waist high bumps.  We also saw some really sick stuff that made my stomach hurt to look at   and some pretty incredible skiiers eating it up.   snow and the slopes were in great condition.

Getting from one peak to the next is a little difficult in some cases depending on which direction you are trying to move.  Beginners may have a particularly tough time with this as many of the connections require skiing intermediate terrain.    Getting all the way over to peak 7 requires a little bit of pumping with the poles on some flat areas.  However it is well worth it for the several uncrowded wide rolling intermediate trails.  We were there spring break week and skiied peak 7 for an entire morning   I don't remember that we saw anyone else there except in the 60 second lift line at the bottom.  re was gentle snow that day   maybe 4 inches total.  We made fresh tracks every run.  It was totally quiet as if we had it all to ourselves.

I can't really judge nightlife   honestly, i was too tired to do much of anything but roll home and sleep.  We did wonder the town a little one night and fell into a excellent restaurant with an award winning wine list.  We had no trouble getting a table.   food was as good as some meals I've had in Zagat reviewed places in Chicago, San Fran, or New York.  We passed several similar places in our little stroll.

 altitude did kind of get to us a little, and my 7 year old complained of a headache a couple of days, but otherwise we just felt a little winded and had trouble sleeping good the first 2 3 days.  We weren't really prepared for this.   next trip we took was much better   drank a ton of water and took ginkgo biloba for a few days before and during the trip.  Seemed to help.

Overall, it was a great family vacation   something for everone.  We are already booked to go back in 2009.",govey80

Very tame terrain, they feel the need to groom every run, everyday! so instead of cruising around i went to the park to ski out the day and get my $$ worth.

4296,2008-10-03,California,Kirkwood,5,"I was a pass holder at Kirkwood, and loved it.  When I first moved to Reno years ago I heard people talk about kirkwood and how they had a pass and how far it was.  I figured it had to be good if people were willing to drive that far (a lot of other Tahoe s are closer).  Those people were right.  Kirkwood is great.  I love the variety of terrain, especially Eagle bowl and the backside.  I gave a low family friendly rating because the area is so big, families can get spread out.   I am not a park skier, so I gave 3 stars.  Nightlife doesn't matter to me, I come for the skiing.   one complaint I have is parking, which is horrible on weekends.  During the week you can usually grab a spot close to the lifts, but on weekends they charge $20 for it.  Kirkwood pass office just called yesterday offering me a great deal on the 6 wood pass, because I was a prior season pass holder.  I thought about it long and hard and almost bought it, but the drive just gets to over the course of a season.  Other than that, I love it.

4301,2008-10-05,Colorado,Beaver Creek,5,"I'm an advanced level skiier and have been skiied BC many times over the past couple of years. This is one of my favorite s in North America. Here are some of my thoughts...

1). Terrain I've always felt that BC has thge most challenging Lift served terrain in the Vail Valley. Both Grouse Mountain & the Birds of Prey lifts offer steeper and more narrow trails than anything that you'd find up the road in Vail.  Golden Eagle Downhill course is an exceptional run, especially if it has some fresh snow on it.  Grouse mountain lift offers just about everything but an easy way down. An advanced/expert skiier will find everything here from Bumps, Steeps and some tight glades (ie. Royal Elk) as well. BC also offers up a lot of intermediate terrain (ie. Groomers) but I have always found them to be longer, steeper and less crowded than what you'd find at Vail. In short, I've always felt that BC has gotten an undeserved reputation as a Country Club mountain. I've skiied all over the West and have been to all of the ""name"" s the expert terrain at BC more than holds it's own.

Lifts Much like Vail, everything is High Speed, except for the Rose Bowl lift. I've always favored this because, being from the East, I like to get as much skiing in as I can when visiting. Some hate it, since it can overcrowd the trails. 

Crowds Always seems less crowded than Vail.  only time that I've ever seen a liftline was during the Holiday season. Recently, they've opened a Gondola connecting the mountain to Avon, Colorado. I hope this doesn't make BC into another overcrowded, I 70 zoo. Guess, we'll have to wait and see.

On mountain facilities Fancy and pricey, just like everything else in the Vail Valley. I've eaten several times in the on mountain Spruce Saddle, usually only a Hot Chocolate and a Cookie. I've never eaten anything bad there but nothing very memorable either.

Village Usually, we stay up in Vail when visiting. I have stayed at BC once (ie. Charter)and found it to be pretty dead. I thought that the Blue Moose Pizza restaurant was pretty good (and affordable for the Vail valley). I also liked the Breakfast Buffet at the Hyatt but it was expensive. re is a free bus that runs from BC to Avon. re you'll find some more restaurants and bars. However, for any real nightlife you have to take the Bus to Vail and at $6.00 each way, the ride can be pricey.

Overall I've always liked BC and still do. I'd recommend it to any skiier, expert to novice.",Queensland Skier
4302,2008-10-05,Nevada,Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe,4,"I've had a season pass here for 8 10 years.  I also ski elsewhere in Tahoe, but you can't beat the convenience of Mt. Rose and the compact variety that it offers.   Chutes are steep and great on powder days, the Slide or East Bowl side has some great tree runs.   Rose side has some fairly steep groomers, along with the gentler beginner slopes.  This is a great family area because each level can ski runs for their ability, but still remain close enough for lunch or breaks.  A lot of locals ski here on long lunch breaks from work, or before or after work.  As the  says, Altitude is Everything, which is true, but is one reason winds can be a problem.  ",ski_hike

Avoid the times when there is new snow in DC or Baltimore.  Pick a warm day, or if you are lucky, a weekend before Christmas because they make a lot of snow.   instructor are great and will take as long as you need!  My sister in law quit and was found hiding in the bathroom, but the ski school staff and her 2 boys were able to talk her into a giving it another try.  Super instructor had her up and having fun before dinner.  y did not make any money on that lesson, but I could tell the staff just wanted her and her boys to have a good time.  I enjoyed the “expert” areas while my family got lessons.   terain park was mostly easy but that matched my low ability.  New skiers can practiced all day but not in the way of people on the back of the mountain.  Hints: Get a hotel if you are coming a long distance.  Get on the mountain at 8am on weekends for better parking and because Liberty’s guest services are up and running.  Take your time in the rentals, getting food and drink, using the bathrooms and be in the first lesson or first lift to the back side.  Get a 4 hour flex ticket if you are a snob or can not ski nice in a crowd.  By 11am you are to late to begin a day at Liberty.  Anyone who is a brand new skier should get the learn to ski package with the add on full day return later in the season, really the best deal on the east.  My rating numbers are for a family of mixed level. ",Juan

Wintergreen is a great place to get your feet wet and learn to ski or board, but if it is variety and long runs you are looking for, then better head elsewhere.  If you do decide to take the opportunity to learn to ski or ride at Wintergreen, you will be able to ski/ride anywhere!   terrain is so slippery and icy that you should be able to easily carve up a nice powdery mountain.

4319,2008-10-14,Alaska,Alyeska,4,"I went to Alyeska with 3 friends in April of 2008 and overall we had a great time. It is a very family friendly place (although we were not with children) and it offers skiing for every level of skier. While there in April we had two significant snowfalls and the  received an incredible 900 inches of snow last season, so fresh powder is not an issue. 

 mountain is quite steep and has some challenging terrain in its back bowls, also there is some nice terrain which is traversable. We found that the place was just slightly crowded on the weekends and essentially empty on the weekdays, so not too many lift lines (longest wait we had was maybe 5 minutes).  lift tickets are very reasonably priced and the  staff is very nice, I took a couple of lessons and my instructor was very friendly and more importantly he was an excellent teacher.

 hotel at the  is very nice, but is a little expensive, we actually were able to rent a chalet very close to the base of the mountain for less than $1000/week! One can also rent condos for around $800/week which are slopeside, so the prices for lodging are excellent.

 scenery is simply magnificent and I cannot say enough about visiting AK, even if you do not ski, go visit and tour around.

 negatives of this  are the following (1) if you are in the lower 48 (like me in Florida) it is quite a trek to get to AK and the plane tickets are pricey. (2) re is basically no nightlife at Alyeska, there is a bar called the Sitzmark (sp?) and there is the hotel with its bar and restaurants .... and that's it. (3) re is a country market nearby with basic groceries but I HIGHLY recommend that when you arrive in Anchorage you go to the grocery store there and stock up for your stay. We were in AK for 9 days of which I skied 7 and unless you go heli skiing or cat skiing in that time, (4) this mountain gets a little boring. Unlike Vail or Whistler, there just is not enough skiable terrain and variety to make it interesting for more than about 4 days. One other gripe I had (and I'm being picky) is that the lifts are old and there is only one high speed quad and it's mid mountain, there is a tram but personally I hate trams, every single time having to remove skies etc., they need more high speed quads.

Overall it was a great time, we did tons of great skiing on fresh powder most days, I would say it is worth the trip in April when the other s are winding down or skiing on corn. ",bwm30
4320,2008-10-14,Utah,Snowbird,4,"Overall, a very good , but it gets overshadowed by Alta's superiority, especially with Alta being just up the road.  re are many good runs off of the Tram, and I've had some great powder, but in 3 trips (12 total days) to Snowbird, I have yet to ski in the sun on the frontside even on days when it's sunny in Mineral Basin.  I'll ski over to Alta on the same day to find deeper powder stashes, sunny skies and a wider variety steeps (chutes, bowls, trees, etc.)  If you could pick up Snowbird and turn it 90 degrees towards the sun and move it away from Alta, Snowbird would be much more impressive as a stand alone .  On the flip side of that, the Alta Snowbird combined pass makes for some of the best skiing anywhere in the world in a single or combined .  Unfortunately, the combined pass is very pricy especially when I find myself spending most of my time in Alta.",govey80

Breeze is a great beginner warm up, and the the two blues next to it are great, long intermediate runs. Cyclone is an awesome headwall black, and Hurricane or any other double black will test the legs of true experts. Wachusett has faster lifts, but the terrain they go to isn't as varied and interesting.  only kind of run Pats Peak doesn't have is the classic New England narrow trail.

4372,2008-11-03,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,5,"We made a spur of the moment trip to Arapahoe Basin as an end of school year surprise for my kids.  We weren't sure if there would actually be snow or not, but the lodging was so cheap in Keystone (less than $100/night) that we figured even if we didn't ski it would be a fun mountain get away.  Lift tickets were a bargain too as my two kids skied free with the purchase of lift tickets for my wife and me.

Well there was snow, and a pretty good amount of it!  About a third of the mountain was open, all on the front side and mostly the beginner and intermediate slopes (in fact, only one advanced run was open due to snow conditions).  What was open was plenty of wide open beginner slopes, and some pretty nice bowl skiing on intermediate runs at the top.  We hit the slopes early, and they were a little icy at first, then perfect for a few hours before getting slushy after 2 or 2:30.  Temps were balmy, and by afternoon, short sleeves were all that we needed   some skiiers were in shorts and bikini tops!

Another thing I was concerned about was that the mountain would be too tough for my family (wife and 2 daughters under 10).  y all learned to ski earlier in the season, so I was worried the terrain would be too steep based on the reputation A basin has with serious skiiers.  Overall, the mountain did ski a little tougher than Breck, but there were some nice wide greens to get warmed up on, then some slightly steeper greens and easy blues to tune up on before heading to the top of the mountain for some of the tougher blue slopes in a beautiful open bowl with incredible views.  re was plenty of things for us to ski for the three days we were there.

I gave the average rating for family friendly because this is truly a skiiers mountain   we were merely lucky enough to be enjoying it when most people we know are headed to the beach!   lifts were a little fast for the kids, and we had some fiascos with getting on the lift the first couple of times.  After the lifties started to recognize us they were friendly enough though, and would slow it down while we got on board.

Apres ski here is different from most places I have skiied.  A bunch of locals were there at "" Beach,"" grilling out in the parking lot like a massive pre game tailgating party.  I'm sure it was a blast to be part of it.  For us, we enjoyed sitting out on a wood deck enjoying drinks from the bar at the end of the day, watching the skiiers come in for the day to join the party.  Everything at Keystone was boarded up like a ghost town as the timing of our trip was really between seasons for that , so it is difficult for me to say as we didn't have a true flavor of the nightlife.

Overall, we had a great trip and would do it again.  After all, we stood on top of a mountain of snow on June 2, and made our last run of the season   swishing our way into summertime.",p_nut
4373,2008-11-03,Pennsylvania,Camelback Mountain,2,"Camelback is an older  built for skiers.  Make that an extremely low volume of skiers.  How else to explain the tiny, narrow trails that seem to invite pile ups.    black trails are less crowded, but every time I've visited they were totally icy.  and sadly, as the saying goes, the trail map writes a check that the snowmaking can't cash... I've never been here and seen all the trails open.  

But I'm not going to write off Camelback altogether.  re are a few nice cruisey runs here, it's convenient to Philly, lift tickets are reasonable, and the facilities are adequate.  I'd just recommend visiting on a weekday to avoid the throngs of wobbly first timers and reckless pre teens.  ",p_nut

tent rental 6k instead of $250, as promised;

4375,2008-11-03,Pennsylvania,Elk Mountain Ski,5,"i've had a sunday pass with forest city elm. for the past 2 years. (this will be my third)

let's be honest here, elk is for people who are looking for a quite, challenging mountain, and thats the bottom line.

pros 
AMAZING and relatively cheap food, spacious lodge. elk has great trails for the upper intermediate. elk makes use of the ENTIRE mountain with its windy and steep trails. elk seems very secluded, and unlike sno  its great to see the open countryside, instead of the lights of the city. the terrain park offers a tow lift and average items. wvia has several ski days here + spring/fall/ festival and demo day the staff is really nice

cons 
lifts are slow, really slow. the good part of the mountain closes at 4... yeah, you heard me right. don't even bother night skiing here  thats what sno mountain is for. THE JUNIOR SEASON PASS COSTS $650.. what is that money going towards? obviously not improvements. elk is stuck in the 1980's of lifts and snowmaking  terrible cheap snow guns and a really low base depth. you can hike up the hills faster than you can ride the lift. harder trails are often icy  and the hardest trail has GRASS inbetween moguls on occasion. theres no nightlife here for anybody under 50, theres usually a country band playing, but if thats your thing, then put on a pair of jeans, get your straight skis, poles with leather straps, and head up to elk mountain before it is forced to close.

you'll have fun here, but if your expecting a vermont experience, dont bother. its a really fun mountain, but those who favor the terrain park won't have much fun. this mountain is way too overpriced  which is probably why most kids take their business to boulder and sno. this mountain is worth a try.",p_nut

It was quite large and had terrain for everyone. MY whole family and the friends we were with loved this place and suggest it for anyone who skis or snowboards. ",psuguy43094

Although I thought the skiing was good, it probably not worth the 70 bucks we payed per ticket. It can be very pricey and the lift lines were long.

In the morning we skied the backside and it was pretty much all ice. at lunch all the places to eat were very crowded so we had to go back down to the town. Northstar had its good trails and MY favorite part was the last run down the mountain as it was closing because the ice and people were gone and the was some decent snow and the sun was at the perfect angle to make everything beautiful.  towm was very nice and there was was some great Apres ski.",psuguy43094

4388,2008-11-05,Utah,Park City Mountain,5,"First of i would like to say, i love Park City!
I can barely find a fall in PCMR, apart from the many knee injuries i have suffered in the pipe and of cliffs and it is very crowded on holidays and weekends, because it is so close to Salt Lake City. My solution to this was to get the Fast Tracks option with season passes. this allows you to skip most of the lift lines on major lifts, great system gained me extra hours on the slopes instead of the lines.well worth the extra money.

 terrain is brilliant, Jupiter and McKonkey's are my picks, hike u p to the peak if you feel like earning your turns (well worth). y also have some great tree skiing all around the mountain...
 town is a great place to walk around after a day out on the slopes.. or go night skiing. your choice but it should be made at Park City.
Being so close to Salt Lake you can easily have a day trip to the shops, or go to a basketball game.
re are so many things to do at Park City (not to mention all the other s close by) 
I love PCMR and will go back very soon, and try some other mountains in Utah.

4389,2008-11-05,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"Excellent all around .  My girlfriend and I spent three days skiing here over MLK weekend.  This place is so big that during a holiday weekend we hardly stood in a lift line longer than 10 minutes.  re is an amazing amount of varied terrain here.  I am an expert skier who likes steep hike to terrain with feet of powder while my girlfriend has only skied 5 days in her life and likes groomed beginner runs.  We both had plenty of runs to our liking especially in the Peak 8 area.  She could hangout on Chair 5 & 7 while I was riding the T Bar and Imperial Express.  We would meet for lunch, ski a couple of runs together, and I would be back to the steeps in no time.  

 ski school is awesome.  While my girlfriend had only skied 2 days when she took her lesson, the instructors quickly assessed that she was an athlete and bumped her up from an 8 person group beginner lesson to a 3 person group early intermediate lesson.  She enjoyed almost 1 on 1 attention, became a much better skier, & had fun.  

 town is pretty fun, but relatively small.  Many of the buildings maintained their original style, but the town is being invaded by buildings with a modern interpretation of what a ski town should look like (It's happening everywhere.  I saw an identical mini mall building in Steamboat Springs and Breckenridge.  Everything from the paint color to the tacky furnishings and light fixtures.)  As for the nightlife, it felt like a ""scene for wanna be hotshots"" at some places and authentic and real at others so its a bit of a mixed bag.

 only real negatives that I saw was the excess of pay parking and excess of condos.  I understand that some people are willing to pay for upfront parking, but when you have to pay for parking because the free lot is so small that it fills up before the lifts open then your pay parking lot is too big.  Condos are great for large groups/families or people that want some place to relax because they don't ski that much, but for those of us that ski, ski, ski, ski, grab some beers and a burger in town, fall asleep, and do it all over again the next day, we need cheap hotel room with a poor excuse for a breakfast, but it's free and fast.  

Overall, a great place to ski.",psuguy43094
4394,2008-11-06,New York,Hunter Mountain,4,"Huntahhhh...may be a lousy mountain but at least it is our mountain (people from Northern NJ and New York know what I mean).

Here are the facts:

*Brutal on weekends because of impossible lines and teenagers in jeans and NY Rangers' jerseys yelling,""Yo Vinnie I am skiing!"" while going a 150 mph.

*Little snow.  snow totals are complete BS. Be prepared for rocket launching pactches of ice and crud even when they clain a ""powder day.""

*Night life used to be lengendary but now, because of the several lousy seasons, has all but disappeared. It is a ghost town. Depressing.

*Lodge is circa 1975. Amenities are sub standard. Food is mediocre.

On the plus side......

*Reasonably close to the tri state area. Certainly within day trip range.

*If you can ski here you can ski anywhere due to the ice, tight trails and crowds. My fondest memory of this past season is ripping down the powder laden trails my first day at Heavenly without breaking a sweat and turning my friend and saying,""Geez. That was fun, wasn't it?""

*Incentive to work harder, invest wiser and save in a more disciplined manner in order to afford more frequent trips to Park City, Tahoe, etc.

4423,2008-11-13,New Mexico,Angel Fire,4,"Went to Angel Fire last year in late December. I heard some good things about the place but it was a big disappointment for me. If you don't get there before the  opens you have to park in a mud parking lot. Some of my friends had to rent equipment and the workers at the rental shop were very nice and helpful. After that we were excited to hit the mountain. We then found out the main chair lift was closed due to the wind, which left us very little options on terrain. I decided to go to the back side of the mountain after half the day. This requires waiting in an extremely long line to take a shuttle to the back. Once there you are almost stuck there.  only way back is a long cat walk to the front, and the only way back to the other side is the shuttle. So you better decide which part of the mountain you want to stay on. I assume this only the case if the high speed lift is closed. Which others had told me they hadn't seen it open in the 3 days they were there. 

So enough about the hassle of taking a shuttle. My next complaint is not really anything Angel Fire can control. y just don't get much snow (200 inches a year). It was late December and they supposedly had a base of 24inches. I think it was more like 18 or less. re was ice, and rocks on every trail I went on that day. It was so bad I had to repair my board with P tex that night. Now that Taos allows boarders I would recommend going there, they get a lot more snow. I was there for the opening on March 19 and the snow was still better than Angel Fire in December. If you like Powder like I do you better hope your trip is planned on a day they get a huge storm, otherwise you will be disappointed. 

Don't let their award for ""Voted number 1 terrain park in North America"" fool you. I have no idea how that happened. I have been to Lake Tahoe and s all over Colorado. Granted, they might have the best terrain park in New Mexico (although Taos, and Pajarito said they have made major improvements for this year) but it is no where near the top 10 even in the COUNTRY! It's more of a joke that they got this award. Just look at Transworld Snowboarding magazine for the real top 10 parks in the country. 

I imagine Angel Fire isn't that bad of a place and can actually be quite fun if you get there after a big storm. Since I get a free day there with my NMX card, I will give it another try this year. I will just make sure it's after they have a descent size base this time. 

 greatest thing about Angel Fire: It attracts a lot of the inexperienced Texans. This intern frees up lift lines and ultimately makes my favorite s safer. ",joey440

4425,2008-11-13,Massachusetts,Wachusett Mountain,2,"This  is only an hour from Norwich, CT and is the best close option for skiing. We usually try to go 3 4 times a year during the week after work. You can be on the slopes by 5 and still get in 4 5 hours of night skiing. We usually try to go after there has been a little snow that day. 

 lodge is actually pretty large for this size . If you are going to eat go to the upstairs resturaunt.  

This mountain is definately not like the ones in VT, but you have to know  that and don't expect that it is before going. If you are planning to go for an overnight or don't mind driving an extra couple of hours you will be more staisfied up north in VT.  

 mountain has great grooming and the lifts are fast, if you go on a snow day or on the weekend during the day expect the long lines at the lifts to prevail. 

If you are used to skinng diamond and above all day then you will be bored, however if you have some youngsters who are afraid of the diamonds up north it is a great confidence builderr for them as the diamonds here may qualify for and easy blue at most of the VT slopes.

I have heard that this year there will not be a half pipe due to some kind of zoning laws but they are planning to put in some new terrain parks.  

We will probable go sometime in Jan provided we get some good snow in southern NE this year. I will let you know more then.

Of all the Mountains in the area I find this one, despite it's relatively small vertical drop, has a lot to offer the advanced and intermediate skier. It also is a great family mountain with a fair amount of easy skiing and good package prices. If your a new skier be aware, there is a vast difference between the green slopes and the Blue, but not a large difference between the blues and the blacks and there are more blues than any other. most of the blues are more upper intermediate then upper advanced beginner. I am an expert skier and find Cranmore quite challenging with many steep runs from the summit to the base. re is only one green from the summit and it has a couple of narrow steeps in it that will challenge a beginner skier. ir green slope is pretty and wide and long enough to give you a good feeling of accomplishment.  green trails from the top of the double chair (Only half way chair) are great for those just new to skiing. Though I'm not a border, their 3 separate terrain parks (easy, intermediate, expert) look like people were having a lot of fun. I miss the nostalgia of the old skimobile but the friendly staff and cozy deck chairs on a sunny day make up for the loss of an Icon.

4447,2008-11-17,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"Day two of my early season start to skiing continued on at Breckinridge.  Breck looked like it had the most snow (which is relative, of course, because it was all mostly man made) and the most runs open.  So we headed out, keenly aware that it would probably be busy since it was Saturday.  We were surprised by just how busy things could be, but the crowds were worth the rewards.

First off, the parking situation at Breck sucks.  Badly.  First off, if you want to get on the peak 7 gondola, you'll have to pay $10 to park close, otherwise you have to go off to the Airport Road parking lot to park for free, then get shuttled in (for free) to the gondola.  Next, the ticket prices are still full price: meaning $65/day, $50/half day, and $41/late arrival (final two hours of skiing).  What a rip.

We bought our tickets and headed up the newer gondola to the base of the Colorado Superchair.  Holy cow was there a ton of people there, all with the same thought on their mind: first turns of the season.  We waited in line for about 25 minutes (see the picture below) and finally got to the top.  We cruised down Springmeier and found the snow soft...a blast to make turns in!  We cruised entire length of the run with little to no congestion on it: even though it was so busy, the run was wide and well covered, so there was plenty of room turn on.

We got to the bottom after our first run, and waited another 25 minutes in line for a chair.  This time, when we got to the top, we went down Spruce.   run was horribly icy (it was mostly in the shade), and people had scraped up the steeper spots trying to control their speed.  We decided to lap Springmeier instead.

So we did.  We spent an average of 20 25 minutes in each lift line for a chair until about 2pm, when we waited about 5 minutes max as the crowds started to thin out.  We kept on Springmeier because the sun stayed on the run all day, so the snow was plenty soft, even on the sides of the run.  I had switched from my carver skis to a pair of twin tips so I could hop off some jumps and butter around and make the run last, instead of screaming down the run in 30 seconds.  This turned out to be well worthwhile as there were tuns of little rollers, knolls, and jumps to hop off and play around on.   soft snow combined with these fun little terrain features really made the day.

We skied Springmeier until close, at which time we jumped on the gondola and headed back down to the parking lot to catch our shuttle back to Frisco  er, Airport Road parking lot.   line for the gondi was quick and the ride back down was even faster.

 only other complaint I would have about Breckenridge (and all Vail s, for that matter), is their new RFID pass system.  Instead of passing thru a gate like at Alta or Big Sky, you have to get beeped by a lifty with a hand held RFID gun.  se guns rarely get the ticket or season pass read on the first try and you can spend up to 30 seconds with the lifty trying to beep the tag before he just waves you through because the system is holding up the line.  It is a very poor system that you can no doubt attribute some of the delay in the lift line to (the liftys did an excellent job managing the maze and making sure the chairs were full).

What could of been an expensive, not so fun in the lift line all day day turned out to be the better of the two days.   weather was warm, the snow was soft, and the terrain was a blast.  and in all, it wasn't as busy as it looked (at least, on the run).",mcc100
4448,2008-11-17,Vermont,Killington,5,"In Europe you expect a steep and perilous mountain road to set the scene for your ski trip.  Approaching Killington you get little more than a gentle incline to announce your arrival.   Green Mountains are somewhat ominously named and perhaps would better be described as biggish hills.

 ski area is the biggest in the New England area but it's only modest by European standards.  It's a big phallacy that everything is bigger in America, as the ski areas certainly are not.  re's also very little elevation, also common Stateside, so you spend most of the day going to the top and coming straight down to the bottom.  You can't get lost but you can't link in with any other ski areas.  re aren't many difficult, or long, runs and the biggest challenge comes from a tricked up mogul field.   snow itself is the nice powdery type you don't get in Europe.

On slope dining is the normal American burgers and fries fare.  No pretty alpine restaurants here.

 town itself is really just a road.  re are some good reaturants but nightlife is very limited.  Things liven up at weekends when Boston and New York descend on the town (best to ski in nearby Pico, also covered on the pass, on these days).   Wobbly Barn and the Pickle Barrel are supposed to be the best ski bars in the East.  This doesn't say much for the rest of the bars in the area.  American apres really would learn a lot from a ski holiday in Austria, France or Italy.

Saturday was a bit chilly and overcast in the morning, but the sun came out in the afternoon, the snow softened and we had a fun day.  Sunday, however, was a dream.

We also ducked into Slidebrook and while not a powder day, it was still a lot of fun.  Apres ski was the best ever as the new plaza was filled with happy people, the sun was bright and warm and a fabulous jazz band from  Berkelee School of Music was playing in he new Timbers restaurant.  That was probably my last day even though I heard Sugarbush will stay open through April.  Looking forward to coming back next winter.",mcc100

No range! y say the do on there web site, ""maybe next year, we had some drainage problems"" they tell you.  NO ammenities to speak of, 2 years after there opening?

4471,2008-11-21,Pennsylvania,Montage Mountain,5,"Great mountain.  My favorite in PA, however, it is extremely pricey.  After seeing the 2008 2009 prices online, I may not be making any trips to Sno this season (unfortunately).  Used to ski Blue Mt. all the time then they got a new 6 pack lift and now the mountain is straight ice by noon so i started going to Sno after that (a little further but worth it).  Loved it from the first day (which was right after the area got 2 feet of natural snow).  Like the glade skiing.  Nothing to complain about but the price is most likely why you never see lines at the lifts.   only way I'm going to this mountain now is on a weekday 8am to 5pm for the college rate ($32...really $40 for youth/college on a weekend...for that price it should at least be all day).  Don't go here unless you want to mix it up or are an experienced skier, there are cheaper places to learn at.",SFCSkiGirl
4472,2008-11-21,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,5,"Blue mountain is on of the best in Pennsylvania, but keep in mind that most of the other s in PA pretty much stink. This is definitely a beginner to intermediate mountain that is relatively easy. This place has the biggest vertical drop in the state but that does not mean a whole lot. When I was last there the snow was somewhat slushy and it was kind of warm, but that meant i could dress light. the two black trails are the best on the mountain but they are not incredibly challenging (however they are nice trails). se black trails would equate to a blue trail out west or up in Vermont.  lift lines we waited in were not bad because the two high speed lifts sped everything up and kept lines short.",SFCSkiGirl

I started skiing here in 1958 and I guaranty there has never been lift served skiing in June.  slopes on Peak 2 are all skiable.

It does get crowded but if your an expert skiier like me you know what trails to go on and what trails to avoid.  Plus theres NASTAR! I'm an avid racer here in PA on the slopes here :)  ,Frank Castellanos
4509,2008-11-30,Pennsylvania,Bear Creek Mountain,2,"What a wonderful experience.  We took advantage of the Midweek Ski and Stay package, which put my wife and I and our two kids on the slopes for two days, including rentals and lessons, and a king suite hotel room for just over $200.  One of the best bargains we've ever had.
 hotel is just incredible   very ""Western"" feel   if you've been to Disney's Wilderness Lodge, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Fireplaces and sitting areas overlooking the slopes everywhere, with lots of comfy chairs and coffee table books.  Heated indoor pool, heated outdoor pool, and two outdoor hot tubs/jacuzzis.  Room was spacious, very nicely decorated, and had lots of everything (pillows, soap, etc).  Staff was incredible, from the extra blanket to helping find my lost cell phone to accomodating some special needs.
Oh, and the skiing...all trails were open except tubing, and all were snow covered with at least 24 36"".  Couple of bare spots, but out of the way and well marked.  Very little ice, no lift lines whatsoever.  Ski School was staffed by really hands on instructors who took what I thought was an inordinate amount of time with each person.  Rentals were a breeze with their great computer system; lockers were plentiful.  Lots of food right off the slopes.

All in all, we can't say anything bad about our stay.  This place is a ""secret"", so I'm hesitant in telling you all about it, but I wanted to give them props for such a great time.  Make sure you put this on your ""must ski"" and ""must stay"" list for next year!",psuguy43094

It had just snowed for the first time this season and they were making snow, so take it with a grain of salt.  y have very few runs and only one blue run was open, which meant everyone was on that run.   runs are too narrow and the snow was very rough and bumpy.  y were also making snow during the day which made it hard to see where you were going.  lift to the top is also very slow, taking a full 10 minutes.  Lift lines were long. ",joe castelli

4528,2008-12-02,Montana,Montana Snowbowl,3,"Snowbowl unfortunately only has two actual chair lifts with two more of the T lines. It's fun but the terrain is very limited and doesn't offer much diversity to skiers that are just starting out. Easy to see in a day, and fortunately doesn't yet have the big  influence and prices (I paid 6 bucks for two slices of Pizza and a Drink) which is definitely a plus. I worked at Park City Mountain Resort and with a fifty percent discount on food couldn't get pizza that cheap, I was stoked, usually I have to take a backpack full of food (do it for the bigger s prices are ridiculous on food). It was overall a good experience, not really for beginners but if your an intermediate or expert skier the bowls just to the right of the second lift are pretty fun. Be ready for moguls and the most old school chair lift I've ever seen. ",mt.skier
4529,2008-12-02,Montana,Discovery,4,"Discovery is a regional ski area drawing people mostly from within 100 miles and there is no lodging or nightlife at the ski area, but a few places 5 miles away around Georgetown Lake. You must stay 20 25 minutes away in Philipsburg or Anaconda for most lodging and nightlife. Discovery lacks good consistent snowfall, but by February most runs are sufficiently covered, yet you should still beware of rocks on steeper runs. Do not bring your good skis before late January. Another reviewer noted that the snow reports are not accurate, this includes base depths that are exaggerated (divide by 2).",mt.skier
4530,2008-12-02,Montana,Discovery,4,"My family tried Discovery for the first time recently and had a great experience. It is a well planned ski area. A safe & low key beginner area with significantly long runs for new skiers. New skiers can gain confidence there without getting buzzed by lift bound hotshots. A second set of lifts serves an adjacent peak with a nice mix of varying intermediate trails with some expert runs. I spent the whole day on that peak while my kids were learning over on the beginner hill.  bowl shape means that all runs on this side of the mountain converge to the same general area, so you can check in on the kids or do a run or two with them, or make a quick stop at the lodge, without backtracking all over the mountain as you see at some areas that have outgrown themselves and have runs in all directions.  backside (north) has some scary stuff that keeps the hotshots over there.",mt.skier
4545,2008-12-03,Colorado,Eldora Mountain,5,"For the local Boulder/Denver skier, or a visitor with limited time, Eldora offers the best skiing for the price. Not only are lift tickets $40 with a coupon, you save about $40 in gas vs. the I 70 s. Main mountain cruisers are long and well groomed, and the steep gladed terrain is absolutely some of the state's best (I suggest Moose and Placer Glades, Jolly Jug Glades for the more timid). Runs are shorter and lifts are slower, but that's Eldora.  beginner (Little Hawk) area is varied, but runs are short.  ski school is very reasonably priced (compare Eldora's prices to a $600 private at Breck), and excellent unless they're overloaded through the holidays. That being said, there are a couple things to avoid at Eldora:

1) Holiday Weekends   like anywhere, holiday weekends here pretty much suck. Especially if the weather's bad. y are made worse here by slow lifts, small lodges, and in a couple cases this year, unexpected rushes because of I 70 road closures. Eldora is a local mountain   they handle crowds (poorly) about 2 weeks per year.
2) WINDY days   I can't stress this enough...CALL OR GO ONLINE. I do every time. Forecasts for Ned or Boulder mean nothing at Eldora, and a bad day (or a wind closure, even worse) can be avoided by taking about 5 minutes before driving the 22 miles up the canyon.

Despite the poor apres ski rating in many other reviews, I recommend checking out the nearby town of Nederland. If you're laid back, and have low expectations, you may find yourself having a great time in this town. It's world renowned for its Bluegrass music scene, and the 1 Street and Pioneer pubs are great places to check it out. If you couldn't find a place to have fun here, you didn't look hard enough.",wisp
4550,2008-12-04,Alaska,Alyeska,4,"A good sized group of us planned a trip last year that fell in line with the Fur Rendevouz and Iditarod Dog Sled Race start in Anchorage.  Alyeska is a relatively short bus ride away.   Iditarod is a chance of a lifetime experience all the way down to enjoying a carnival atmosphere and a reindeer sausage on the streets of Anchorage, and thats the only time of the year they serve a reindeer sausage.  On to the  review!

 experience at Alyeska was great, a lot of the runs are carved out of a huge bowl area as opposed to what a lot of people are used to.  Very diverse terrain, and I would say that strong intermediates will have a good time here, being an expert isn't totally necessary but yields more opportunity.  Lift lines were very short.  If you stay on the hill when the sun starts to go down beware of the flat light in this type of terrain, it can play tricks on you and if you're not looking for markers specifically on cat tracks you could miss a turn.

4551,2008-12-04,Colorado,Wolf Creek,4,"Been taking the family skiing to various places the past few years in NM and Southern CO.  Wolf Creek was fun.   snow was good, staff helpful and friendly, and lines were not too bad considering it was spring break.  Apparently they had just recently put in their new 4 man lift that goes to the top, and it really helped move people up the mountain.  Nice long easy green run from up there to if your skiing with your kids or beginners.  Lots of variation in runs for all types of skiers.   ski school was a bit overbooked and understaffed, so after just a half day I pulled my kids out and gave them my own lessons.  Looked like the instructors were frustrated with the situation as well, so maybe they were having staffing issues.  If your looking for a GREAT kids ski school, take them to Taos.

We stayed in Pagosa Springs, and I cant say enough about the locals.  Very friendly, and happy to have you in their little town.

I believe this run is named after a ski industry legend, Ace Heise, who is rumored to still be working for the company after many years.  food at the  is good and the DC's restaurant offers a nice variety of cuisine. After hours at Wisp, is a really treat.   has comedy night, live bands, a kid’s night out program and much more. Not to mention that this  boasts a great tubing park as well as a mountain coaster that the kids and adults love. ir variety of programming offers something for the guest of all ages.

It is huge, and overall is a more intermediate to advanced mountain.  second mountain is the one the locals know. You haven't truly experienced Crystal until you have hiked the King, explored North Back and bombed down the Teddy Bear Chutes. I have skied at Crystal almost every weekend for the past 5 years, and I have never gotten bored. This is definitely not a mountain for the timid, or those discouraged by cold weather. It can be brutal, but Crystal has the best snow I have ever skied on in Washington. Even if it hasn't snowed for a week, you can still get freshies if you know where to look.  one downside is there is no nightlife or terrain park.

It is a well rounded ski area. the only drawbacks are it's lower on the mountain, and generally recieves less snow then the other two areas higher on the mountain. When skiing at skibowl, explore the trees, the areas with out a marked run and follow any tracks that you see leading of into a diffrent area. and on top of everything, the staff is so much nicer then at meadows and the prices are better.",pdxboarder
4564,2008-12-06,Washington,Alpental,4," Summit at Snoqualmie has a reputation for moderate terrain, but that refers to Summit West, Central and East.  Alpental is another story.  Alpental is full of steep, hard, narrow, and out there.  It is also full of very good skiers, but little attitude except ski hard.   Chair 2 (as it is known) is what takes you to the steeps.   sign on chair 2 says 'Experts Only'.  This is serious    don't go up unless you can ski down a black diamond mogul run because that is the easiest way down.    backcountry is a lot of fun.  You need to check in at the ski patrol hut at the top of chair 2 and it is a good idea to take advantage of any tours they give of the area.   Also you want to watch the Summit website for special days at Alpental.  re are lots of fun events throughout the year, and the locals like to dress up silly and have fun.  Cinco de Mayo is always a blast.   A lot of skiers where crazy costumes    or in some cases, just their skivvies (course those few and brave ski very fast :)

I voted 'not family friendly' but that of course depends on your family.   re are lots and lots of kids at Alpental, and there is a big kids ski program at Alpental.  It is just that these kids are good skiers    heck they are skiing chair 2 after a few years in the program.",Eli

I had been following the weather all week,  and when I saw that Belleayre had been dumped on,  I new the time was right to get the skis out and ready.
             I drove up from Connecticut. It was a fast two hour ride, and as I got close I was wondering where all this snow was. Not to fear,  as I came up the hill to the mountain , there it was. 
             A short wait in line for my ticket, ($25) and I was on the lift by 9 am. I  parked at the lower mountain lot and took the lower mountain double up the hill. I skied down the green to strech my legs and loved it. This whole area is perfect for my wife, real easy and alot of terrain to keep her happy all day.
            I took the big chair to the top a few times and it was nice, however there were alot of people up there that shouldnt have been and it was tight. I am sure that when the entire mountain is open, that problem will be solved. Cant wait to come back with the whole family!    ",Gunny J

We were envisioning a place to go for february vacation week during the 2006 season, and decided to go to Bretton Woods. It's a little less than 2.5 hours from Boston. We rented a Forest Cottage, which had 2 bedrooms (1 with queen bed and 1 with 2 twin beds), a full kitchen, living room, washer/dryer, etc. Great place to stay, very convenient as well!  shuttle made getting to the mountain but also to other parts of the  like the hotel as simple as walking onto the slopes... This definetely won't be an issue so don't worry about it.  mountain is very spread out. re are massive amounts of terrain for beginners/intermediates, but there are also some surprisingly good glades for beginning advanced and very advanced. If you like glades, and there is good snow (which there was that year!!!) you will love this place. Lots and lots of glades, very varied, fun, and little travelled. Some are pretty steep too. Did I mention there were A LOT!? y are all over the mountain, come in all levels of difficulty, and are really fun! re is so much variety that on the second year I went I was still finding new ones.  rosebrook canyone ones are the main attraction, very little travelled, never saw more than 1 other party there. Beautiful glades, some beginning advanced but mostly advnced.  ones on west mountain are easier for beginners, and are very nice too, but less ""backcountry"" feeling. Also, there are a few good bump runs too. If you only like really steep clear trails, this is not the place for you. But, you can stay here and go to Attitash for a day, I haven't tried but it looks like a ~30 min drive from Bretton Woods. y have some glades, but their main attraction is steep terrain. 

We went back for the 2007 season, same great place, unfortunately it rained, but they did a good job of keeping the glades open.  groomed trails were fine. 

If you are a crazy, extreme, backcountry middle of nowhere skiier, go somewhere like mad river glen or stowe. If you are a family, even with moderately advance skiiers, this is an excellent place for a vacation, especially because of the other s nearby.",Ontheslopes
4709,2008-12-22,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,4,"I visited Blue Mountain last Thursday (Dec 18) for the first time. It was a good trip overall. I enjoyed that they had more vertical rise than 7 Springs (my usual ski place). I also enjoyed the lack of crowds   we never waited for a lift.  college student discount was plus as well ($10 off lift ticket). 

I would say that the biggest problem that I had with Blue Mountain was its deceptive website/trail map. y said they had 22/30 runs open. We found ourselves skiing the same four runs all day though. y rename a trail sometimes three times. I should have studied the snow report and trail map a little closer, but we still felt a little deceived by their 22/30 runs open. 

Best run of the day was challenge   the double black diamond just to the left of the Challenge Express Six Pack. 

I have every intention of going back, just with a better feel of what is open at the mountain.",molly young
4716,2008-12-22,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,4,"BLUE MOUNTAIN

	 largest of the Pocono area ski s is also the closest to the Philadelphia, Reading, and Allentown areas.  Blue mountain does as much as it possibly can with its “highest vertical drop in Pennsylvania”, with two mile long beginner trails, 3 large terrain runs (one for each beginners, intermediate, and advanced skiers and snowboarders), two double black diamond steeps that run the full length of the mountain, and a host of other trails, all with snowmaking and night skiing.



 Good:

	A large, fairly steep mountain to work with allows Blue to create a huge variety of trails.   often icy Challenge and Razor’s Edge trails drop off like a cliff while the narrow Burma Road weaves back and forth along a gentle slope, allowing beginner skiers to have a mile long run all to themselves.  Three terrain parks, a mogul run, a snocross run (a personal favorite), and several long, wide intermediate and advanced cruisers add even more variety to the mountain.

	 layout of the mountain is simple: all skiers disembark from their lifts at one of two “peaks” and each trail leads to one of two base areas.  ( lower, larger base area is accessible from the higher, smaller one.)  Two high speed lifts carry skiers and riders from the bottom of the mountain to the top in about 5 minutes.



 Bad and the Ugly:

	Being the furthest south of the major Pocono s forces Blue Mountain to contend with serious icing issues.  Even the most advanced skiers will find it difficult to hold an edge on the steepest trails on a Friday or Saturday night, after the trails have been chewed up all day.  Be warned and just expect that it WILL BE ICY!

	Another problem that stems from Blue’s location is the crowds.  Even with both high speed lifts running, it is not uncommon to wait for up to 15 minutes for a ride up the mountain on a nice Saturday or Sunday.  Popular trails like Main Street, Lazy Mile, Burma Road, and Vista can resemble a highway at rush hour, but there are usually escapes.  (Try Razor’s Edge or Upper Switchback!)



 Best Trails:

	BEGINNER: Burma Road.  It’s narrow, so it is often difficult to avoid new skiers and boarders that will inevitably sit in the middle of the trail, but the terrain is gentle and interesting at the same time.  Besides, where else in Pennsylvania can you find a green run well over a mile long?

	INTERMEDIATE: Switchback.   most often forgotten trail at Blue has a name that describes it well.  It cuts back and forth across the mountain, making a 45 degree turn every 150 yards or so.  Some sections can get steep, though, so nervous beginners beware!  Look here for a break from the crowds on busier days.

	ADVANCED: Razor’s Edge.  Between a steep beginning and end (the two steepest spots on the mountain, other than the 300 foot long Falls trail), the trail levels out a bit into a wide, sweeping cruiser as it skirts along and under Blue’s highest capacity lift.",skifiend

After you can master this little hill you can go anywhere and have fun.  It is hard for beginners but we taught both children at this mountain and now we can take them anywhere and not worry about if they can make it down. re are not a lot of runs but follow the locals to some fun stuff that isn't posted and you will never run out of a challenge.

4723,2008-12-23,Idaho,Magic Mountain Idaho,4,"If you live in South Central Idaho or are traveling through, give Magic a try.  Easy to get to, homey/historic day lodge (part of it from circ. 1938) and good people, staff & locals.  Ski all the groomed runs and then ask a local for directions to their favorite powder holes and they'll probably take you.  Short to medium runs, some will get your attention and keep it, some good cruisers and a few that could use a guide.  Don't overlook the old mountain formerly serviced by the still standing T Bar, lots of hidden treasures. 

Intermediates and advanced will enjoy, beginners will be challenged but once comfortable will manage any other hill with confidence (I learned here over 40 years ago and swear by this!).  For kids with a little imagination, the whole place is a big terrain park.

No two mile runs or mega steeps but a high probability of a good day skiing many laps (do 30 or you're a sissy), most ending right at the next chair ride without standing in line.

But there are way too many people.  Too much competition for fresh snow.   tree skiing is not  my favorite.  re are very few double blacks, few steeps.  It is very expensive.  It FEELS commercial.

People think vail is IT.  I disagree.  I agree that it is good, but not the best.
What IS the best?  I'm actually not going to say where I prefer in Colorado.   places I prefer are already crowded enough, they don't need more people.  But I would say this  if you always go to Vail, you should start trying out other s as well.",nzh0tg

Snow was a little slow that year but the overall experience was still outstanding.   Headwall and Teocalli Bowl are enough to keep any skier busy for days.  Possibly the best cruising run I have ever been on was International.   wide open trails really leave a lot of space between you and others.  Crowds are not a factor here, the longest I waited on a lift line was 5 minutes and this was the week after New Years.  I would recommend Crested Butte to anyone, especially anyone looking for a challenge in downhill terrain.

One time we went it hadn't snowed in over a week, yet we were still able to find plenty of powder without much searching.  groomers were extremely fun, especially on the left side of the mountain (townsight chair lift). 

Pajarito is a very affordable trip. Especially if you go with a few friends. You stay in Los Alamos which very cheap especially if you search on the internet, and it is ony10 minutes or so from the . I would recommend taking your own lunch or buying something from the town before going to the .  food on the  is a bit expensive for just a burger and fries. Oh and they also don't sell alcohol of any kind on the , BUT they do allow you to take your own. I saw a lot of people break out coolers of beer during lunch and workers walked right past them and didn't say or do anything. This is awesome, and actually saves me some money. 

After a great day on the mountain you can find some nice places to hang out in Los Alamos.  city isn't very big but you will find some friendly locals. re is a good selection of restaurants (especially for breakfast, just look for restaurants on Trinity road) a cool bar with some pool tables, and a small ater with 4 screens.

Keep beer out of the main level coolers or someone might be sharing it with minors. Think about it. What's the point of having a bar area, if you're selling beer elsewhere? 
Even with the full park running, the lift ticket prices are kind of outrageous.

Staff on the mountain were nice, and despite the crowds, lift lines were reasonable at all but a couple of the lifts. Rode several lifts all day long without waiting in line at all. Nice mix of terrain for all skill levels.
Off the mountain, however, I felt like a nuisance, as opposed to a customer. Do NOT go to Lakanuki!! Unless you are an old woman looking to score on a busboy, you won't get any service at all. I sat at a table with my teenage son, and 3 daughters, and in almost an hour, did not so much as get a glass of water, or even asked if we had been helped. Despite the fact that there were plenty of staff flirting and constantly appearing to look for work to do, (or perhaps just checking out ""the scene""), we got ZERO service! Even when I asked someone who our server was, he said ""I don't know"" and ran off. He proceeded to ""check out the scene"" several times, walking past us, and flirting with the 2 women seated next to us, before we finally got up and left. Went to a couple of other places, and while the experience was not nearly as bad as the AWFUL LAKANUKI, not really anything to write home about either. 
People were generally just not very nice. Not overtly rude, (except while driving maybe), but just not what I would call nice. Spent a week in Vail earlier in the month, and EVERYONE we met there was super nice. All the way from the people in DIA, right up to the mountain. Staff & guests alike. I would drive the extra 10 hours to get my family of 7 there than go back to Mammoth. ",Robert Turner

We had six and seven in our group, with no problem staying together.  do a great job of grooming the mountain.  bowls were fun, but the lift lines were longer there, than on the rest of the mountain.
Great resturants, with exceptional service. Two Elks Lodge, at the top of the mountain, was very nice. With two feet of snow predicted for the next two days, I would go in a heart beat, if I was able. Very nice upscale .",Robert Turner
4858,2009-01-03,Nevada,Lee Canyon,3,"Been skiing this park every year for the last 25 years. Every time I ski it, i tell myself, never again. When I started skiing there in 1983 the lift prices were $16. I know everything goes up in price but I think $40 is a bit much for this old rock pile. I have skied all over N. America in the past 25 years, this is the only place that I ever got hurt! If you catch a perfect day, plenty of snow( very seldom ), a lot of sun ( improves icy conditions ) you can have a good time. I live on the northwest part of Vegas 10 miles from the strip, I can be in the parking lot from my front door in 35 minutes, this is a big part of why I continue to ski here.",Robert Turner
4866,2009-01-04,New Mexico,Taos Ski Valley,3,"I've lived in NM twice in my lifetime, and have skiied at Taos a number of times beginning in the the late 80s and most recently in Feb 2008.  One trip in 1997 remains one of the best ski weekends of my life.  It's an old school ski area...very little glitz, but lots of great terrain.  As everyone has heard, Taos finally opened to snow boarders last March.  (As far as I know, Hell has not frozen over.)  

Taos is a  for serous skiers...not for posers who want to be admired.  If you come here, it's for the steep and the deep.  I'm ashamed to admit that I have not sampled Taos' hike to terrain, which by all accounts is impressive.  But even if you are not so adventurous, Taos has a lot to offer for the advanced skier.  Al's Run, of course, is a must.  

  is quite a way from the town of Taos, and the offerings at the mountain are limited.  If you plan to stay in the town of Taos, though, I can highly recommend the Taos Inn, a great place to stay with historical significance.  Doc Martin's, in the hotel, is an excellent place to dine.

                           once again I did not have to share a chair almost all day. On the ride up and about five minutes from the mountain it started to rain. This may account for the poor attendance. However, the rain stoped 2 seconds after I got out of the truck , so I walked over to the lineless ticket window and purchased my lift ticket. I didnt know what the weather was going to do, so I planned to ski hard with no breaks.Took the SunapeeExpress to the top.  visability was bad for the first hundred yards or so , but got better as you came down.  snow was perfect, and remained that way all day. I did stop to eat my sandwich at around 11. I got there early enough so that I could park in the front row and got to ski right to my truck. I ate in the truck and watched the few skiers that were there, come down the hill and not wait to go back up. After lunch, I got back on the mountain and skied till it rained at around 1:30. I was bummed about the short day but still left with a smile on my face. ",Ontheslopes
4885,2009-01-05,Pennsylvania,Roundtop Mountain,4," staff of Ski Rountop is what makes this place great. Me and my friend were absolute newbies and every single staff member, from the ticket booth, to the rentals, to guest services, and to the instructors went above and beyond. My friend had quite a bit of difficulty snowboarding at first, but our instructor took time to keep her spirits up and listen and provide her some great tips.

I'd like to thank Steve, who was incredibly frank with us on how the learning curve is going to be tough.. he even let us know not to be discouraged because it took him five trips to the slopes before he got the hang of it!

We bought the mountain passport and will be back.. its an absolute steal. Free lessons all year? How the heck could you beat that!?

re were some negatives.  bunny slopes were way too icy (they could have blown some snow, it would have been helpful) and the bathrooms needed to be cleaned. But other than that.. not much I can say bad about the place.

4896,2009-01-05,Vermont,Okemo Mountain,5,"Me and my son stayed in the mnt lodge condo right neer all the action. Next time I will request my room on the first floor. We had to walk up over 3 flights of stairs to get to our room. We went for 4 days Nov 27 30 2008 and we had no crowds on the lifts. Since it was early in the season only 9 lifts and 27 trails were open. That was fine with us because we really don't need to go on every trail. We were happy to be skiing and riding this early in the season.

 town is small and has about 5 or so places to eat. We liked the Pot Belly. If you go to the Wicked Good Pizza place bring cash, they do not take credit cards. This the least expensive place to eat on the main drag.

4897,2009-01-05,California,Sugar Bowl,4,"Headed up to Sugar Bowl for the first weekend of '09 with 3 friends.  Its a pretty straight shot from the Bay Area and a quick exit being so close to Donner Pass.  This was my first time at Sugar and I was impressed with the steeps.  I've only recently become a double black rider and I managed to scare the bejeezus out of myself twice without killing myself or my friends.  Tahoe's getting pricey and Sugar Bowl is no exception.  We got ""discount"" all day lift passes for $60 dollars.  Where are we,  Canyons?

It was a good day of riding though and even though the snow pack isn't what it is on Sierra, Kirkwood or some of the other big name s, the corn was covered enough that it was a fun obstacle and not a danger to our boards.  Plenty of blues and real challenging blacks to be had.  re was an unusual number of riders bumping into skiers and vice versa, but that may have been an aberration and not the norm at Sugar.  I'll find out as I definitely plan on visiting again.",vedhed
4901,2009-01-06,New Mexico,Taos Ski Valley,4,"I visited Taos this weekend for the first time. I've heard how challenging the mountain is, but I found that most of the groomers were almost identical. Not as steep as I thought they would be. Pretty challenging off shoots from the catwalks.

Beware the wind there had swept all new snow off the main trails. I would only go back to Taos if there was plenty of new snow.  conditons this weekend were not that good.(windy and pretty icy.)

 staff there was also very discriminating against snowboarders, although in my opinion, snowboarders already outnumbered skiers. 
On my first run of the day, my lift ticket was scanned but the ticket checker stood in front of me and let about twenty skiers behind me get on the lift first. Finally I had to ask him to get out of my way so I could get on the lift. He gave me a rude look and reluctantly moved out of the way.

Check the snow report before you go. If there's not any new snow, I would advise the extra drive time to Wolf Creek.  snow there is always good, and I have never seen the early season conditions there (Wolf Creek) as bad as they were at Taos, and staff is also much more friendly towards the people who generate most of their revenue.(snowboarders)",bermjl
4902,2009-01-06,Pennsylvania,Bear Creek Mountain,4,"Bear creek offers great terrain for beginners and intermediates, I would think experts would get bored here after a while.  have a great terrain park maybe the best in PA.   is large enough to keep you occupied in all the trails for a few days, they could use faster lifts, but hey its a small place.

 As far the  goes it is EXCELLENT best ever in PA, they have new lodge, hotel, and conference center, the hotel is great and views are even better, the spa an pool are great, the lodge offers wireless internet everywhere and so does the hotel, leather sofas a fireplaces make this place even better, if feel the mood for better food, they even have an upscale restaurant in the same place, it is great.

 You don't have to drive out side of the slopes to have a great family fun. Great place to learn park, or perfect what you know, we went a week before they closed and we the place for ourselves, and a few other locals. Staff is quite friendly and they even upgraded our room slope side view for free.  rooms are very nice and comfortable. I believe in the last years they invested a lot of cash into this place.

4903,2009-01-06,Pennsylvania,Spring Mountain,3,"FYI, I'm a mid 20s girl. I've been to all of the major ski places around the Philly area for the past decade. I don't rent skis and I didn't take a lesson here. Didn't use terrain park & didn't check out nightlife. First, the positives... my folks hung out in the restaurant part of the lodge away from the crowds downstairs.  waitresses there are the absolute nicest and will give you coffee/soda refills all day without ever telling you to free up the table. Also, the upstairs bathrooms are clean and don't stink. I went to the ski school to buy a lift ticket (no line) and got a good description of the open trails and conditions. y didn't blast any snowblowers at the lifts or skiiers   a wonderful first! Trails not too icy. Also, they check lift tickets at the base of the hill so the chairlift lines don't get as congested. Weekend/holiday crowds are fairly small!

Now, the negatives.  slopes here are really small and simple. Like all the other reviewers mentioned, there are tons of teenyboppers here and a lot of the little boys will try to kamikaze you for no apparent reason. You also need a bus ride to get to the right side of the mountain (blue & black trails)... a total pain.  chair lifts are super slow   1 lift took me 5.5 min to go up and 1.5 min to ski down casually. Plus your butt will hurt from the seats. Parents w/o lift tickets aren't allowed onto the hill to take pictures (...unless you sneak in thru the side by the parking lot... you didn't hear that from me).

Overall advice: if you have young kids, are easily intimidated by skiing/snowboarding, are kinda cheap, don't want to go far, then come here. Intermediate+ athletes, non teens, people with a flair for luxury, you might want to try somewhere else. I'd definitely revisit next time I just want to do lots of smooth easy runs.",danmclaw
4906,2009-01-06,Wisconsin,Devils Head,2,"Great big place with runs for people of any skill level.  y have long bunny hills great for learning on.  they also have nice long intermediate slopes and many black diamonds. y offer many different features in their terrain park including a half pipe!  Up north gives them alot of snow and always a good chance to shred on some fresh powder.  I love going here and they offer many cheap rooms to lodge in overnight for that fun winter trip

Just about everything was open except a few of the double diamond trials.

My daughter took a good tumble on Upper World Cup and hurt her elbow pretty good. Ski Patrol was very good, Professional, friendly and caring they helped make the event less hectic. We will definately be back again this season.

But the best thing about it is its unsurpassed terrain. You'll find anything like super steep cornices, narrow chutes, cliff jumps, large natural halfpipes, a lot of bumps, and the best tree skiing in Tahoe. Kirkwood has runs that challenges the most advanced experts, yet it is also the best beginner and intermediate  at Tahoe.

4912,2009-01-06,West Virginia,Timberline Mountain,4,"Lodging/Dining:

For the past four years, a group of about 12 of us now ranging in age from mid late 20's have been renting a slopeside home. In my opinion this is the way to go. Whether it is the handful of houses on Salamander or the growing number on Winterset, you will not be disappointed. Other than the obvious luxuries of ski in/out and a hot tub, the house enables you to bring and store your own provisions. This is something that we learned quickly after our first year. Davis is a small town, and has little in the way of groceries or dining. re are some restaurants in town, but it is mainly mediocrity. Plan on long waits if it is a Friday or Saturday night in season. re is supposedly a great restaurant that is popular with the telemarkers, but I have not been.  food at the lodge is ""okay"" and nothing about it is upscale. If you are in to nice food, eat dinner and lunch in your house and then go to the lodge after dinner for drinks. I have seen the lodge get rowdy on Fri/Sat after 9 10 PM, and have watched families get rightfully irritated if they are not done with dinner by then. y have tried to separate the bar from the dining area, but it does not always seem to work well.  fact that the lodge is not upscale also makes it incredibly fun.  laid back, very inexpensive bar has colorful and sometimes talented local musicians on the weekend, and the crowd can be a lot of fun. Don't expect pampering, class, or anything resembling the village at Snowshoe. Unlike their Intrawest neighbor to the south, Timberline does not try to gouge you or try to be something they are not. Let's be honest, with the exception of Ember, the food at Snowshoe is nothing special either. 

 Mountain:

A friend and I skied the main part of Snowshoe early/Dec and were averaging about six runs an hour. This is not going to happen at Timberline. Go there knowing and expecting that.  lifts are slow and obsolete. Ten minute lift ride on weekdays, and about 14 15 min on the weekends. Obviously, such a lack of uphill capacity can become a problem on busy weekends. I would argue however that the number of people on the mountain on a Saturday is not that high, the lifts just simply cannot handle the volume. Despite waiting in line, the more difficult trails never seem to overly crowded. Maybe I have just been lucky? We always arrive late Wednesday night and enjoy the mountain to ourselves on Thursday and Friday. Deal with it on Saturday and leave Sunday morning. We have found this to be perfect. I would not let the slow lifts deter you, it's a great hill. I think you can stand in line on the main section of Snowshoe for just as long on a busy day. With the exception of Cupp and Shay's, I would still rather ski Timberline. Unlike the main section of Snowshoe, Timberline has not tried to over pack their terrain with slopes in order to boost their trail count. I feel like they have made a conscious effort to make their trails continuous for as long as possible without greenies converging from everywhere once you make it halfway down. This is not to say that this is totally not the case, but not nearly as bad as what you will find at Snowshoe.   right side of the mountain has three nice blue cruisers that are fine for a weak intermediate, but have the ability to keep a stronger skier entertained as well. ""Almost Heaven"" and ""Dew Drop"" will keep you occupied, and each have a few enjoyable steeps.  newest slope ""Twister"" is fun at the top, but turns into a painfully slow green at the bottom.  blacks and doubles are all fun, and all offer some challenging spots. ""White Lightning,"" the widest trail on the mountain, is fairly steep at the top and can be a great run if you are fortunate enough to get good conditions.

Bottom Line:

This is not to put down Snowshoe. Who doesn't enjoy skiing Snowshoe? Who doesn't think Cupp Run is the best trail,  in the area? se are simply two different worlds. I am confident a good trip to T Line will keep you going back year after year like we do.

4924,2009-01-07,Pennsylvania,Montage Mountain,4,"Very experienced skiier and we visit many s in the East and some in the West (usually get in about 50 days of skiing per year).  We were visiting familiy near Scranton over the New Year holiday, so I took my two sons for the day.  We had skiied many years before (as Montage), and we were looking forward to the new management as Montage Mountain.  We were very dissapointed.  While many of the runs have great potential, the  was run very badly.  Only highlight   good grooming on the ""blacks"".  y groomed early, then blew a nice coating of new snow on the steeps and left it alone.  Very nice.  All else was bad.  This is the big Holiday week, and despite claims of some of the best snow making, only about half the  was open.  How about getting off the lifts and having the try avoid gravel mixed throughout the snow?  Not once did they bother to pick up a shovel and throw some new snow over the gravel.  How about trying to put your skis on a rack and having to step over equipment all over the place   no order (and not even that crowed for a Holiday).  Not enough racks, poorly placed and no free ski/board check.  Lots of kids with rental skis just dropping them all over the ground.  Where were the employees?  How about trying to get something to eat, and every table covered with clothes, bags and equipment. No place to sit, and no employees trying to get people to store their equiment in lockers and keep the tables clear for eating.  It was not a cafeteria, it was a large locker room.  Food prices were high even for a ski , and the quality poor.  Lift tickets were high as well, particularly given the quality of the skiing experience.  Overalll   what a shame!!

Ice was a big issue on the top beginner trails    the worst place to have it.

Wish they could step up their game, this place has so much potential.

4931,2009-01-08,Indiana,Perfect North Slopes,3,"As long as you don't expect wonders from 400 vertical feet, Perfect North can be quite a bit of fun for the family.  It is definitely geared towards families as there is no bar in the lodge, the lifts are slow with frequent stops, and there is a vast amount of space / lifts dedicated to first timers.   kids should have fun here.   

Unfortunately, many ski way beyond their ability, here more than many places we've visited.   Too many times we saw rental skis in a pile on a steep slope with the person being escorted down the hill in a stretcher.   Despite this, they have some really good terrain for the 400 feet they have to work with.   Center Stage is fairly steep and challenging for advanced skiers.    Far Side is a long trail that will appeal to beginners and some intermediate skiers.   Tuff Enuff and Special Effects are gradual slopes top and bottom with a steeper portion in the middle, and make a nice intermediate run.   re is an excellent variety of slopes with varying grades.   Everyone will find a slope with the grade that suits them.       

 lodge is fairly large and roomy and prices are moderate.  Pizza is well into the decent range.   Although there is no bar, it appears to be a BYOB facility in the times we were there.    Plan ahead, pack a cooler with food, etc.

Finally, we are frequently surprised at the huge amount of snow they have.   y must have a tremendous snow making capacity, with loads of snow at times where other s in the area seem to be bare.

4990,2009-01-14,Montana,Blacktail Mountain,3,"If you are a local of the Flathead Valley or if you just like skiing with locals, Blacktail is the mountain for you. 

In the valley their are two choices Blacktail Mountain and Big Mountain (now called Whitefish Mountain Resort). In this review I will compare the two to give you a little insight.

Terrain   Big Mountain has more acreage and more lifts. Blacktail has all the same type of terrain just less of it. I would give Blacktail a huge edge on grooming. In fact toward the end of the season Big Mountain quit grooming all of its terrain which made for some horrible surpises once you started down the run.  is no terrain park at Blacktail so if you have kids that want to do that Big Mountain is the place for you.

Ski School   My kids have particpated in ski schools at both hills and I would say that the instruction is the same. Big Mountain does have a nice magic carpet.  nice thing at Blacktail is that there are fewer people to watch you in the early on embarassing stage.

Day Lodge   I give this one hands down to Blacktail. Sure Big Mountain has a large new lodge, but it is very confusing and staff are not very helpful. Which leads me to the next category. 

Employees   staff at Blacktail are so much more polite, respectful and helpful. I think that they staff at blacktail actually care about how your day goes. at the Big Mountain this year while trying to figure out the whole process for my daughter to rent, get in ski school, and all the other things that go along with that I had absolutely horrible service. 

Anyway that is my comparison. See you at the best ski hill in the valley, Blacktail.",mt.skier

 mountain is huge, with lots of terrain.   terrain is naturally divided, separating the beginner, intermediate and advanced skiers/boarders to some extent.  Even the close to the bottom blues had plenty of tree areas in which one could find fresh powder and tight turning if so desired.   upper mountain blacks had some challenging terrain, and there were always non mogul options for boarders and others who don't like the bumps (unlike at winter park).   backside has lots of expert level terrain as well and I'm sure it would be fantastic on a  powder day.  I am intrigued by the free snow cat access to the ""in bounds backcountry,"" though I didn't get a chance to sample it on my day out.  

I didn't get a chance to sample the terrain parks, but they have a few!

 parking/bus/village system is very nicely set up, making it easy to get around off the mountain.  I didn't spend any time in the village, so I can't really speak to the nightlife, but it looked like there were lots of options.  

It was on a weekday, so I can't speak to the crowds on the weekend, but since it's just off I70, they're probably pretty fierce.  

 fact that the  purchases wind energy credits for 100% of their power use only makes it that much better!

I have several more s to sample in the area, but I have a sneaking suspicion that Copper Mountain will be my new home!",smezhir
4998,2008-12-22,Idaho,Schweitzer,5,"To all the posters bombarding Schweitzer management for closing on April 6, PLEASE consider this.

Schweitzer was the site of a ski movie after the mountain closed. So sure, with 160 inches the could've reopened after the filming was finished   or only certain areas of the mountain. That's not the case. Hosting this ski movie entailed the terrain park management and grooming team moving around  literally HUGE amounts of snow to build two very large jumps. Even if they had reopened, popular portions of the mountain   like the terrain park, Midway, Ridge Run and much of the Basin Express terrain would be closed due to lack of snow.

I have met members of Schweitzer's management team. y are competent and know what they are talking about. Many have been in the ski industry for 20+ years. When they make a call that they're going to have to close, I stand by their decision   and if the posters were truly loyal to Schweitzer, they would agree.

HOWEVER, I will say that it would've been cool to ski the chutes in May. It probably would've entailed a download on the Basin Quad though.",Terry

5003,2009-01-15,Montana,Whitefish Mountain,4,Great mountain to learn to ski exterme terrain. I spent the winter here in 06 07 and still was finding new terrain to ride by spring. Had I come back the next year I would have found more new terrain. Lots of good hikes to steep terrain and lots of good sustained tree runs. One problem is that the mountain is growing in staure and more people are choosing Montana over Colorado.  mountain is developing quickly and without any prospect of stoping.  once small town of Whitefish is now becoming a one with the much larger Kalispell. finding afordable places to stay is also difficult. ,mt.skier

5009,2009-01-18,Michigan,Swiss Valley,4,Just an update to last years review.  Swiss continues to be a great place to visit from Northern IN.  I love the atmosphere   everyone is friendly even the visitors.   facilities are clean and the equimpment functions well  my only complaint is the tow rope in the begginner area.  Small children who have never skiied struggle with it.  However if your kids are getting lessons I noticed that the staff is very good about helping the kids up the hill.  For older kids and adults I highly recommend bringing either an old pair of gloves or a pair of work gloves if you will be riding the tow rope.  It is very hard on gloves.  Not a lot of  terrain but you would have to go several more hours north to get much better.  Ratings based on southern MI.  ,Alan M

5013,2009-01-18,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,4,"In response to the review about the ice and reckless skiers, first of all, you mention night skiing.  Anywhere you go in PA at night is ice.  While Blue does get icy faster than other mountains, learn to ski with it.  Sharp skis (assuming your not renting because if that's the case forget going on the double blacks) will solve the ice problem.  I was there New Years day and like always, the double black were icy but still manageable.  and with the reckless skiers comment, unless you are talking about ""good"" skiers on the ""slow"" trails, people can ski as fast as they want.  While this doesn't mean cutting people off is allowed but I've never seen that problem.   only issue I have is people standing around (especially at the top of Falls, having a nice line coming down challenge and getting to people standing at the top of falls because they cut over from lazy mile not knowing I guess).  This mountain is only good on weekdays.",Christopher Horner
5014,2009-01-18,Pennsylvania,Elk Mountain Ski,5,"I try to ride at Elk a few times a year. It's never crowded. Every body up there is pretty nice.  conditions are usually good.
Elk is trying to move into the present slowly but surely. Each time I'm there I see improvements. 
Better Park features the last couple years. I was there last week and they added a fun mini park. Also, a couple of new rails and boxes in the other park.  jumps were medium sized but smooth. Well maintained features are always a plus. Good riders in the park, and they were all cool with us non locals. My friends and I always have a good session there. re is a surface lift in the one park, nice, you can just stay in the park. This is cool because you can see everyone else in the park on the way back up. 
 trails at Elk are pretty long. Some have cool turns and lines.  Kikapoo is really fun. I don't think it's open yet though.
Overall, Elk is as fun as you make it.",Christopher Horner
5032,2009-01-19,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,5,"Went here for New Year's.   previous week was warm and rainy and all the legendary feet of snow they had was completely gone.  However, there was a blizzard on the second day that was fun to ski in and after that the snow was pretty good.  This mountain has enough to keep you busy for a few days although advanced skiers and riders will get bored with the few black diamonds and the fact that the black diamonds are usually in the worst condition because the steepness causes the powder to fall off leaving ice exposed.   blue squares are usually in the best condition.  

 night skiing is good  they have great lighting and snowmaking that makes it a bright, enjoyable experience.  However, the close the blacks at night so we never got to try the blacks on the mountain that's open at night.  

 mountaintop location of the entire  is very cool.  You can ski walk to the top of the slopes from where you stay.  ",jssctrent

5047,2009-01-20,Vermont,Burke Mountain,4,"I loved Burke like crazy from the third day of snowboarding in my life for the killer trails and the beautiful mountain veiw itself.  first time I went down a slope(a flat bunny hill named Carter County)I could'nt stop falling. I did not know what to do because knobody taught me how to turn but in the middle of my third day my dad gave up trying to teach me how to turn left and right because he skiied and knew nothing of snowboarding so he finaly got me a lesson. My dad told my instructer not to take me on regular greens and just to take me on the bunny hill.So me and my instructer taught me how to turn left and right as well as breaking before he said I was realy ready for the reagular greens and since he was a snowboard expert I trusted him. It went uphill for the rest of the vacation and I had a blast on the normal greens for the last day and a half.  next year I got back on and tried some great blues such as Deer run a great woods trail for a first blue square  trail but it did have some flat places. I also tried  Big Dipper wich was a beautiful and wicked blue trail wich was one big hill. I did open slope a blue terain park with 4 obsticles but ovoided the obsicles. I did mountain marsh wich was a steap blue sodont fall down cause its harder to get up thenfall on it. Anywase the food selection was great and not half bad eather.  rentail people,instructers and other workers there were super freindly.My last comment to say is that I LoVE BURKE MOUNTAIN!!!!!!!!!!!",swetsb

We have always gone over Christmas breaks in December and the conditions have been awesome.   town of Park City is so fun.  re are tons of swanky and yummy restuarants, as well as great bars to grab some drinks.

Fantastic snow conditions (in January at least), we've only been ""snowed in"" one time in six years, and even then we got in a couple of good days of skiing.  More mellow and laid back than Vail itself, but Vail's only a 10 min. drive down the road for shopping and dining.  We usually stop for lunch at the Red Hawk camp, great food.  re are some good restaurants down in the town of Edwards, at the bottom of the hill, try Juniper for terrific fish and veal.

Seneca has been our favorite so far cause the rooms are spacious, there's an indoor parking garage for all guests, and it has a huge hot tub outside! When the weather is cold and the mountain is covered in snow I have never seen any place more beautiful, and since everything is at the top of the mountain you have great views!

I would gladly pay that price for not skiing on man made ice.  We were even able to find a few powder stashes left in the woods.  Was the closest day I have had to Western Resort conditions in the East.   long lift lines are a burden, but they also regulate the flow of the mountain.   runs were never crowded  and if you ski through lunch the lift lines bet much shorter.   biggest plus is I did not hear the scraping sounds of a snowboard all day.  I am convinced the conditions stay better because there are no knuckledraggers on the mountain.  Get there early or you will be parking up the street and plan on heading elsewhere for apres ski.   Common Man is a short drive away and is top notch.  ",dubisaweapon
5061,2009-01-21,California,Mammoth Mountain,5,"I spent MLK weekend at Mammoth Mountain.  I hadn't been there in about 15 years and forgot how fantastic it is.  Despite not having new snow in 3 weeks, the mountain had adequate coverage aside from a few exposed rocks on the upper mountain.

 mountain is truely mammoth in size.  Despite being a busy vacation weekend, I never waited in a lift line longer than 10 minutes and most of the time the wait was less than 2 minutes.   mountain is extremely interconnected.  re are so many lifts criss crossing the mountain that traversing from one end of the mountain to another takes no more than 2 chair lifts.    best terrain is off the upper mountain (the gondola and chair 23) and the inner peaks of chair 3 and chair 5.  (I can't comment on the Avalanche Chutes off of chair 22 because there was no coverage on the entrances, but I remember them being very good.)  Cornice and Scotty's were very good all weekend, but the entrances to Climax, Paranoid Flats and the Dropout and Wipeout Chutes were extremely exposed.   best snow was off of chair 3 and chair 5.  

While I am not someone who ventures into the terrain parks, I can certainly appreciate the quality of the multiple parks.  Not only was their multiple parks, but there were areas for beginners, intermediates and pros as well as a half pipe.  

 only area that I didn't give a perfect score to was the nightlife.  re are adequate places to go grab a drink, but my problem is more with the dining choices.  re was certainly a lack of affordable dining options.  re were very few options that fell between McDonalds and a $25 entree.  I can appreciate the inflated prices of a ski /town, but the few places that were reasonable were so packed with people that we couldn't even find parking to figure out what the wait time was.  

Overall, a legendary ski area!",govey80
5062,2009-01-21,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,5,"I would probably consider this my home mountain, it is the best mountain you can get to in less than two hours from the Philadelphia area (less than 1.5 hrs from n. 'burbs).  I usually go several times a year.  re is a nice variety of trails, from the winding Paradise and Burma Road (great for kids) to the no nonsense Main Street to the fairly extended steeps of Challenge and Razor's edge.  Lazy Mile is fun but too crowded on a busy day.  re is also something about the place which seems to attract a lot of younger skiers and (especially) snowboarders who tend to be aggressive and even rude at times.   litter under the lifts is kind of sad.  

I wish they would let bumps build up on either Razor's Edge or Challenge, if they did these would be AMAZING mogul runs.   one ""mogul"" run is the pre fab Barneys' Bumps on the side of Main St. 

 two bottom to top high speed lifts are awesome!  Maybe they'll put one in to replace the Main St. lift someday?

 Valley Lodge is easier to get in and out of, and though it's kind of bare bones it's reasonably comfortable.   cafeteria in the Valley Lodge is not that hot, the food is too pre cooked and the atmosphere is...cafeteria.

I don't know what happened to the snowmaking operation, but Loon has gotten real good at making HARD PACK instead of snow.  Loon itself has listed HARD PACK as a priimary or secondary surface for many of the last 30 days.  Is it the lack of appropriate training or hiring the cheapest possible labor without concern for a great guest experience.  y have cut back in many departments and it shows.  Thank God it has snowed a bit over the last week to cover up a perceived lack of concern about a great ski /snowboard experience while jacking up lift ticket prices once again at more than twice the Consumer Price Index.   lack of enthusiasm is written on many employees faces.

If you know what happend that week (6ft of snow in two days) you will understand why I loved my time at this mountain. Beyond that great memory I think the mountain is very compairable to other s in Colorado (Beaver Creek). Lots of terrain, lots of off mountain activities, and lots of lifts.  worst and best part about winter park is that lots of people come from Denver to ski, which means the city of Winter Park and Frasier are rather quiet because most people only stay for the day.

5086,2009-01-21,Pennsylvania,Spring Mountain,4," Good:  This is the place to go to learn to ski or to have your kids learn to ski.   instructors at the Ski School are good natured and expert at teaching first time to intermediate skiers.   Given the close proximity to Philadelphia, you can get to Spring Mountain in about 30 minutes (from Chester & Montgomery Counties) and 40 minutes (from Phila, Bucks & Delco).   low price for lift tickets makes for a cost effective outing (weekend adult is only $35, a 10 lift ticket for any person any time is only $269 and good deals on lessons and rentals).  Short lift lines (even on weekends) is another big plus.   Oddly, this also seems to be a great hangout to read, as there were many folks in the lodge with books (probably parents of kids taking lessons).  Finally, the outdoor food / hot chocolate concession is both convenient and cheap.

 Bad:  While fine for honing your skills, the slopes offer little challenge for advanced intermediate and above skiers, and the Diamond Trails never seem to be open.   Also, with the exception of the french fries (which are excellent) the rest of the cafeteria food is below average.

I live in NYC and been skiing killington since 2000.  This mountain, by far, is the BEST mountain on the East Coast of the US.  Can't compare to anything in Utal, Colarado, or California, but the simple four hour drive makes it the best.  I'm a father of two and my wife skiis...i'm a lucky one.   s north of here do have better snow, but no where near the size and options.  This  is the best.

Although crowded, if you stay on black, double black diamond trails you will be a safe distance from those yahoo rude snowboarders and reckless skiiers.

Pros:
 Plenty of Double Diamonds (easy ones...not west coast doubles)
 Plenty of Glades (I say more challenging than west coast)
 East 4 hour drive from NY and 2hours from Boston
 You can stay Cheap ($80/day) in various hotels just 20 30min away from base
 A lot for everyone from beginners to Experts...everyone will be happy
 Great nightlife if you like Live bands and decent restaurants
 Great snow and great terrain
Big Mountain Feel
Cons:
  Big Mountain with 5 bases may lead to people getting lost
  daycare is UNACCEPTABLY EXPENSIVE...New owner raised the price beyond the reach
  of middle class skiiers...$130 a day is too much.  Daycare shouldn't cost More than a liftticket.

I fell in love with the ridiculously steep slopes, the vast endlessness of the view from Rendezvous Bowl, the insanely deep powder, and the local scene.  I went back the next year and decided that after I graduated college I would move there.  Folks, if you haven't ever lived at a mountain as a local and been there every day of the season, DO IT NOW.  I promise, you will have the time of your life and you will probably drop all of your original plans and follow a new dream that involves skiing 100+ days of the year.  Who cares if you're only making minimum wage, right?  Jackson Hole is, hands down, the best place to ski in North America.  Whistler is great, but the snow in Jackson has that ""champagne powder"" quality and the conditions are much more reliable.  I woke up to fresh snow almost every day I lived there.  But beware, this place is NOT for beginners.   intermediate ""blue"" runs have the pitch of many ""black"" runs most other places in the country.

5105,2009-01-22,North Carolina,Ski Beech Mountain,3,"	What happened? I had skied many times at Ski Beech a few years ago and always had a great experience. Again, what happened?
	I used my previous experience to persuade a group of 20 to give Beech a try. So, yesterday we made the trip. It was freezing (about 5 degrees), snow was falling, and the wind was gusting. However, that was no big deal. I mean, we were going to be skiing. Right?
	My first trip down the slopes was a nightmare. Every snow blower on the mountain was pumping wide open.  winds was blowing the ice crystals right into the faces of the skiers. You couldn’t see a thing. Everybody was crashing into one another. God help anyone who fell and couldn’t get up before someone plowed into their back. A tremendous number of people were complaining. Many skiers just gave up and went home.
	 snow blowers and the winds were creating total white out conditions. It was an incredibly dangerous situation. Yet, that’s not the worst of it.
	I, along with other concerned parents and patrons, tried to plead the case of the skiers who were enduring a horrendous day. I approach a number of Ski Beech employees and could not believe the total disregard for the safety and concerns of their guests, and the utter rudeness with which I was confronted. One employee in particular replied, “Learn to ski with blowers or ski on grass. Get over it, dude.” We finally took our case to the management who were just as rude and uncaring. 
	Now, I understand that there may have been a legitimate reason to blow snow. However, could someone not have taken the time to explain the reasoning to us, rather than denigrate us?
	n, to top it all off, my wife and I were trapped on the quad for over 45 minutes in the frigid conditions after a transformer running the lift went down. Perhaps they should connect the lift to the transformers supplying the snow blowers, because they certainly didn’t break down. We were given no consideration or even offered an apology for enduring the precarious dangling above the slopes while ice crystals from the blowers blasted us.
	 staff and management of Ski Beech could use some lessons on customer service and human relations. Maybe someone should remind them that employees represent overhead, while customers represent profit.
	I will never return to Ski Beech and I will tell every skier I know to avoid this place. re are too many other great s in the area.",bangsezmax

However, the lift operators were trying to put max people on the lift chairs and the inexperienced skiers were having a tough time. y had trouble getting on and a lot of trouble getting off.  People were piling up like cord wood and the lift operators just kept the darn things running.  It was a joke at times.  Later in the day, the lines were unbelievably long. We would ski for 10 minutes then wait for 45 for the lift.   lodge is incredibly small, too.       ",bangsezmax

This mountain lacks variety. Sure there are 8 peaks but there are only 3 4 runs off each peak and they are all the same and the peaks themselves, from lift bottom to top, are only 1,000'  1,500'  vertical making short, uneventful runs. Also the snow conditions for the week were bad to OK however while Sunday River picked up 6"" of fresh stuff over a two day period, other mountains in the general area (ME, NH, S. VT) picked up much more snow and had true powder conditions not dust on crust/ ice. I can see this being a fun family mountain but there are much better mountains in the Northeast with better snow, vertical, and variety.",Brian Thayer

Conditions were great. re was top to bottom skiing and it was cold.  cold temps made it possible for them to make snow all day in different places. y were not 100 percent, but what trails were up and running were almost perfect. Attitash is just outside North Conway, so if you are looking for a little nightlife, this mountain is for you. It is kid friendly as well. I saw the ski school at different times and they seemed to do a very good job with the kids. Cant wait until all the trails are open so that I can ski between both peaks. Bear peak was open this weekend, however, you had to ride a shuttle bus to and from. I Wasnt willing to spend time on a bus, so Bear peak will have to wait until next time. ",J Berlo

5120,2009-01-22,Tennessee,Ober Gatlinburg Ski,3,"We just went to the  the weekend before christmas because we wanted to experiece skiing and snow tubing.  Parking in downtown is difficult, you have to pay for it. When we arrived on Sunday, there was a notice posted on the ticketing window that the slopes are close due to weather is not cold enough and snow tubing is still close, which disappointed us since it is the reason why we went there.  I asked the person at the window when the slopes are going to open, that maybe the next day since its really going to be cold and she replied that it may take several daysor week.  With that, we just looked forward with our reservation we made through the phone which was a package consisting of unlimited tramway ride, scenic chair lift, bungee run, indoor ice skate, and alpine ride.

So, the next day we head out to the , we didn't get dress for skiing because they told us they're close for skiing, just to our surprise when we reached the  the slopes were open but still no snow tubing as they advertise that it will open that date.  We were going to settle on our group package but one of them (alpine slide) is close.  When we asked if they can give us a discount to get other rides or exchange it to someting of equal value, since we paid for it they said they cannot do anything about it.  and that we would have appreciated it if they told us ahead of time while we're in the office down the mountain instead of finding out when we're already up in the .  and we needed to get what we paid for.  ir reason was that the reservation wasn't made through their office.  I responded that there was no other way to purchase the package anyway except for that person on the website (which apparently on the marketing depeartment).  y said if we have a complain is to talk to them which means we have to wait and ride the tramway to go down to the office.   customer service was so poor.  So, to not spoil our day we just let it go and went ahead to what we can do.  Two of our friends ended up purchasing tickets to ski, it took them an hour to get the tickets and everytime they ask a personnel about what they need about skiing or whatever they need to do (their first time to ski), they get a rude remark like ""didn't I just told you that!.

 staff are foreigners, they appear to be having a problem understanding english and cannot explain themselves too.   rest of us ended going to the scenic chair lift.  When we got to the peak of the lift, my daughter had to use the bathroom, the one for public use is close.  I asked the staff pleasantly if there's a staff bathroom that she can use because she really really needs to use one, and his response was the bathroom is close beacuse of the weather.  What relation does the weather has to do with the bathroom?  We cannot run down because we are at the top of the mountain, there's no other building or facility around and the only way to go down was to ride the chair lift which would take 20 mins to get down.  and the person that's taking the picture was pressuring us to order the pictures, we were still discussing if we're going to buy the pictures and he just bluntly said  ""do want the picture or not!, ok if you don't want it, don't take it!."" in a rude way.  Me and my friends are in just disbelief that we haven't met a staff that is pleasant and friendly considering we are paying customers of the .

After we settled, the kids went to the bungee run.  re were no other people there except us. So, the kids tried it, they enjoyed doing it, they wanted another turn, so we told the crew and he said we have to wait for an hour to get a second turn.  We question him why, our wristband is for unlimited rides, and there was no other person waiting in line, and he still did not let my kids do their second turn unless we wait for an hour.  

My conclusion, I will not come back to ober gatlinburg  and i don't recommend it.  But if your going to stay in a cabin and do sight seeing, the view is breathtaking  and relaxing.  We will visit other ski  around virginia instead.",jssctrent

Second day warmed up and got slushy and crowded, but for a while the ground between the slopes was actually white and beautiful.  se folks do a pretty good job of maintaining the slopes as this was the first weekend in March and there was a descent base for the fresh snow to land on.  Stayed at Wilstem (sp?) ranch (really nice folks), which was much nicer than the previous slopeside lodging.  re was an outdoor hottub, a little snow falling in the afternoon with sun shining in the distance: a family moment we will always remember.

It also gets icy and it is pretty common to see people hurt all the time.
I used to buy season passes there, now they doubled the price and limited the options for youth, so I guess I will pass next season and make two trips to Colorado instead. Not sure what they are thinking, with the gas price as it is a family day there with rentals can be prohibitive.",wisp

When we first arrived we were excited to find 28 inches of new snow the day after Christmas which made for great skiing.  What we were dissapointed to find was how overcrowded the slopes were by Monday since they advertised a limit of 5000 tickets per day.  Every day was sold out according to the announcements posted on the slopes, however on Monday we discovered they had sold 8200 tickets for that day.   lines were ridiculous and you had to wait up to 30 minutes for a table at lunch.  I even had to park way down the street from the  as their parking lot was filled by 10:00 am.  We were there 5 days and it was obvious they had oversold tickets that day and the skiing was just trying avoid hitting people coming down the slopes.   other days were reasonable but my question is why do you advertise a limit of tickets sold and then oversell by that much.  It seems a little greedy to me!  We go skiing every year at this time and the reason we chose Deer Valley was due to this advertising of a limit on the tickets.  As far as I'm concerned we will not be returning here around Christmas as it was very difficult to enjoy skiing when you are dodging poor skiers all day long!  ",A. cooper

5158,2009-01-23,Indiana,Perfect North Slopes,3,"  Perfect North is my ""local"" area   1:15 away.  Over the last few years, I've really come to appreciate what they offer.  I find myself wishing they had a bit more vertical,  but there is a very good variety of runs.  From treed runs to longer blue cruisers to the moguls and steeps.  You've really got to appreciate the time and money invested in what was Indiana farm land to create a legitimate ski area.

  Fantastic snowmaking.  y have had 100% of their terrain open for many weeks.  Far sooner than any other ski area within 300 miles.  se guys make snow like nobody's business.  Another plus is that 100% of the runs are also open for night skiing.  Very reasonable lift tickets.  I like the fact that your lift ticket is good for 8 hours regardless of when you start rather than the usual 9 a.m   4 p.m hours like many areas operate.  So if you sleep in and don't get to the slopes until 10, you can ski until 6 (then you can add 4 more hours for just $10).

  Large lodge (although it fills up quickly on weekends/holidays) with relatively good food at reasonable (for a ski area) prices.  Despite the large lodge, it does fill up quickly on weekends and it seems a lot of people ""claim"" a table for the entire day or have one non skier ""camp out"" out the table   so often times you can forget about finding a place to sit at lunch. Nothing like eating while standing up and seeing a large table with an ice chest on it and 1 non skier sitting there reading a book.

  Because they are the best thing around, they do get crowded on weekends/holidays (although this is no different than many other areas)   and there does seem to be plenty of people skiing beyond their abilities.  This year, I have noticed an increase of ski patrols on the slopes in an effort to police the out of control nuts on very crowded days.

  If you want to ski the tree runs, do it early in the morning   the orange lift gets very crowded as the day goes on and beginners move up from the bunny hill to the Far Side.  Move over to the red/white lifts in the afternoon.

  Like someone mentioned before, we are fortunate to have such an area nearby.

5169,2009-01-24,New Mexico,Angel Fire,5,"I have skied Angel Fire a good part of my life, in addition to many other s in New Mexico and Colorado.  Overall, Angel Fire is my favorite, and where we chose to purchase property and make our ""second home.""  Angel Fire gets its share of knocks, some justified, but most can be overcome with a few simple tips.  First, don't rent your equipment from the  if you are going on Christmas, or Spring Break.  You WILL wait a long time in line, as ""First and Last"" noted in an earlier post.  Instead, choose one of the 5 shops on the ski mountain or in town.  If you want to get on the lift at 9, be there to pick up your skis at 7:30, or better yet, the day before.  Most shops will let you rent after 2PM for then next day.  We like Cottams, but Mountain Sports is good too.  If you are wanting to rent a condo, try VRBO, instead of the .  You will save some money, and usually get better service.  Have a four wheel drive vehicle, or cable chains.  Angel Fire is prone to ""dumps"" and can get a foot or more of snow in a few hours.  No snow plow crew can keep up with that.  Several of the condos have steep inclines to enter, and if you have 2WD and no chains, its a long walk to unload!  Buy your lift tickets in advance, and plan your meals at slower times.  Eat lunch closer to 2, and you won't fight the crowds.  Also, try the Summit Haus for lunch.  y are at the peak of the mountain, and not as busy as the base.  80% of the peak crowds ski between 11 and 3.  Plan to hit the lift at 9, and you will have some time to yourself on the slopes on the front side  even during peak season. n, hit the back before lunch  that lift is usually not as busy.  For night life, hit Zeb's (Zebadiah's) during the week, and visit the winery on Friday and Saturday nights.  Or, catch the live music in the Lazy Lizard at the  hotel.  Also, think about a snow mobile tour with Angel Fire Excursions.  I can't say that I have not been to friendlier s, but most of the  employees are nice and helpful if you give them a chance.  Frankly, they are often overwhelmed with the big peak crowds.  Cut 'em a break, and most will go out of their way for you.  For condos, stay in the Wren, French Henry, Aspen Park, Low numbered Chalets, Moutain Spirits and Gold Creek.  Avoid  Lifts, Ski Run, Snowfire, Pinetree.  re are no true ski in/ ski out condos in Angel Fire, so beware anyone advertising one!  First time skier?  I would say the most important thing is that EVERYTHING takes 4 times as long as you think will.  Double what you think and double it again, and plan accordingly.  You will be less frustrated, and have more time on the snow!  Above all, have fun!  Angel Fire has some of the best downhill terrain anywhere, well worth the few negatives.",Randy Whitson

5210,2009-01-26,Vermont,Okemo Mountain,5,"Ok, now that I live here in VT, I get, from the locals, a bit of disdain for this mountain   they seem to not think it is as good as others that the natives use, such as Jay + Sugarbush... Killington lies in the same category as Okemo, in their eyes   for the out of state people!  Well, I came from outside of Albany, NY + would visit Okemo occasionally + always found superb conditions. But, Stratton was closer + usually won out.  I get the mid week pass + have it paid for by the beginning of February, with the times I go there.  Stratton has a much more welcome feeling, with smiling face to greet you.... but you deal with more crowds, and the top is usually blown off + all ice. Not that Okemo doesn't get that way, but it won't remain that way for long, due to the incredible way they tend to the mountain conditions!  I have to tell you Vermonters: You can go all day + never do the same slope (unlike Killington that seems to only have trails that rarely lead to a slope) twice!  But you will want to do many of them twice or more!  It is just that they have so  many good slopes to choose from (they have the most trails, next to Killington, in the state) + it never seems crowded!  As for the steepness, well, it is just right for me   their diamonds might not be true black diamonds, but you can sure get your money's worth by the diversity of them + have a LOT of fun.   half pipe is so much better than most, if the others even have one!   Hey, Hanna Teeter trained here + got where she got, for some reason! and, there are plenty of glades + even a double diamond glades area that is absolutely magical among the white Birches!, but only for the experts, for sure.
It is indeed snowboard heaven   well, not as much as Heavenly, in Tahoe, but for the east, I think it is as good as you get!  and they have plenty of deals like $39 tickets on certain days   ck their website!  But the midweek pass at $299ish includes Stratton, Sunapee + Crested Butte (I think that is the other mt.n) in Colorado!  Can't beat it!  and you can ski the top more often than Jay!  Think Snow, everyone   the more, the better!  I would love to beat the 22 feet they got in Tahoe a few years ago.  i know! I know!   not gonna happen out east!  Oh well, I can dream, can't I?  I would like to just see what 22 feet of snow looks like!!!!  Maybe I will see you there!  Try it, you'll like it!  Maybe yrs ago, Okemo didn't compare to the other mt.ns, but it sure does now!!  and you can always start riding or sking in November + into mid April!!  You get more for your buck, for sure!!  Hope you do yourself the favor to check it out, but not too many of you   I like it not feeling crowded!",Shane Wicken

Great food with a gourmet flare. re is also the Big Powderhorn lunch room and bar as well as the Caribou Bar & Restaurant on the hill. Around the corner is Pub & Grub which has a great fish fry Fridays.  Big Powderhorn free bus will take you to any of these and back to your chalet, so you can have that last beer before hitting the road.

In town there are many restaurants, and just across the boarder is Hurley, Wi, about 4 miles away. Let's just say you wouldn't bring the kids to the bars in Hurley, whereas the restaurant/bars in Ironwood and on the hill are OK for all ages.

5233,2009-01-27,Wisconsin,Cascade Mountain,5,"What a delightful surprise!   An easy drive from Chicago (3hrs) or Madison (<45mins), Cascade provided a great skiing experience from the moment we drove into the parking lot.   Lots of staff on hand to make it easy and quick to get on the slopes;  well organized parking lot,  barrier free walkway to the lift ticket window and base.  Just pop your skis on and you can be riding the hi speed quad in minutes.     longest lift line was less than 5 minutes  courtesy of staff keeping the line moving and filling every chair.    hi speed quad takes skiers to the top in about 5 minutes, while another triple chair serves the same runs in about double the time (so that's why there was NO lift line...)   
A great feature of the mountain is the beginners trails which run the entire elevation, rather than just the lower portions of the .  Experts will enjoy the more challenging trails on the east portion of the slope, with intermediate trails on the west.   All trails were meticulously groomed, despite deteriorating condition when we visited.  Lifts were in great shape, with little to no mechanical problems, and almost no stops.  
Snowboarders seem to coexist happily with skiers on all trails, but terrrain areas were very well marked to avoid unintentional entry.    I'm not a boarder, so I can't really comment, but it did look like there were some pretty complicated structures in the terrain areas.   beginner area was well contained,  with a blissful lack of rope tows, and three dedicated chair lifts.   ""magic carpet"" was being worked on when I passed by, but was located in a secure area preventing new skiers from wandering away, or other skiers from disturbing them.   I was easily able to give my ski buddy some pointers and we moved on.
A quaint coffee shop provides warm beverages and lite snack with an amazing view and a very toasty fireplace.  (Starbuck's for those of you who are wondering.)  main lodge is bright and airy, with somewhat limited seating upstairs.    cafeteria selections were not many, but along with the typical burgers/chili/chicken tenders,   salads, a deli sandwich and wraps were available for more health conscious skiers.    A small, but open bar area has dibs on the two story floor to ceiling views, although the scenery is well viewed from anywhere in the vaulted room.  Numerous flat screens were available for sport fans to follow any number of games.  Downstairs in the main lodge was  a small snack counter and ample area of BYO; and one group took advantage by bringing a large crock pot of chili and another of rice.   Multiple vending machines offered fast and easy access to snacks and beverages.    re are also two mid mountain restaurants which we did not even have time to visit, Daisy's features a large ski in/out outdoor patio area that would be amazing on a sunny day!
Clean lockers were easily accesible (.50) with a compact area including 3 dressing rooms, making it comfortable and easy to get ready and gear up in the lodge before heading out.    re is not a huge amount of room, so with a couple of large groups, it has the potential of being uncomfortably crowded.
Located in the rental building, the ski shop has all the essentials to make up for any forgotten or failed gear, with a suprisingly good selection of equipment and accessories.   prices were quite fair as well.  Although we did not need to rent gear, the rental area was as clean and well organized as the rest of the .   
Skiers taking Far Out can view the snow tubing runs (requires an additional ticket), with two magic carpet type lifts.  While I didn't see any ""tubers"", the  makes it look like a lot of fun!
re are several options for lift tickets (flex ticket) which offer what I felt were a great value for what Cascade has to offer ($44 49 adult/day/weekend).   We took advantage of one of the local odging packages: 2 all day adult lift tickets, 1 night lodging, including continental breakfast for $149 + tax, which I thought was a fabulous deal.   It was a little difficult to sift through the info on Cascade's website, but well worth it.
My ski buddy was a first timer, and was able to get his ski legs quickly, and access all areas of the . While I am a long time skier, we still enjoyed (almost) every run together.    I would especially recommend Cascade for new skiers. I can't wait to go back, and look forward to bringing the kids this time.",Yoonseok Song

However, we had great weather that day.  This would have been a questionable decision otherwise.  When we got there, our day started out bad, but ended great!  A young guy offered to sell me a discount ticket in the parking lot, which I bought.  When I went to buy the second ticket at the ticket window, the (very snotty) girl told me that was illegal and would not accept it.  I had to buy another ticket, and when I asked to speak to their security person, the girl told me I would be prosecuted if I reported it.  Considering it was already after 11:00, we decided to go ski and deal with this later.  We had a fantastic day on the slopes at Powder Mountain.  Great runs, little crowd, wide open.  After we finished skiing, I found their Administrator, Angie Illum.  Angie could not have been any friendly and helpful with the situation and sincerely apologized for the incident.

5267,2009-01-29,New York,Plattekill Mountain,5,"We first discovered Plattekill about 3 years ago and have made it a point to try and get there at least once a season ever since.  We would go more often, but it is quite a haul for a day trip from the Jersey Shore.   mountain is a throwback to old time skiing with an eclectic mix of oddball switchback trails that make exploring the mountain a real adventure.  Throw in the steep, constant pitch, diamond runs down both faces and the fact that it sits on the hairy edge of the Lake Effect Snow Belt and you have the makings of great ski area with a 1000 foot vertical to boot.  My college aged daughter and I skied Plattekill on 17 January 2009, the Saturday of a 3 day holiday weekend and it was great.  With the temperatures set to start at below zero and barley make it into lower double digits, we figured that the crowds would be a bit less, but the crowds here were totally non existent.  We did not wait in a single lift line, and there was many an empty chair.  It was blue sky, no wind and packed powder all morning.   temperature stayed in the single digits for the most part, but with no wind, it was fine.  It started to cloud up a bit in the afternoon.  All the tree branches were covered with a think coating of frozen ice and snow, making for a surreal looking, magical forested mountain.   weight had many of the branches bowed over to the point where it was a challenge to navigate the narrow switch backs which are unique to Plattekill.  Conditions were great with lots of natural snow on the surface and many remnants of fresh natural powder.   mountain does not make much snow, so you have to hit it when conditions are good to really appreciate it.  We were originally targeting Belleayre, but made the last minute decision to drive the extra 20 minutes up to the Kill, and it was well worth it.  You won’t find any high speed quads or fast crowds here.  With the steepness of the trails giving you a good workout, I kind of appreciate the added rest of the long slower chairs.",perrmj02

With all that soft, fluffy powder, you can bust big time without having to get carted away in the little red sled thingy.

5312,2009-02-02,Utah,Snowbird,5,"re's a battle that goes on in Utah.  at least between skiers, there's a battle going on.  and it's probably one of many battles.  But this one surely is on going: is Snowbird *the* best  in Utah?  Some would argue so, while others will argue that Alta is.  So who is right?

To be exact, no one is.  Alta remains my favorite ski  anywhere (not just in Utah), but Snowbird is a very close second.  Alta and Snowbird could almost be considered the same s in regards to snow and terrain.  Snowbird is just a bit bigger...but also just a bit more developed.  re's gives and takes to each , and an argument between staunch supports of each can go on for ever.

I didn't get to ski Alta this past weekend (we had a boarder with), so we did the next best thing: Snowbird.  Snowbird has terrific snow, tons of terrain, and a great lift system to allow for quick and easy access to anything on the mountain.  We opted out of the tram ticket on this trip because there hadn't been any fresh snow in 7 days.  We decided to save money and just utilize the Peruvian Chair and tunnel to access anything we needed in Mineral Basin.  This was a good decision as it saved us a few bucks so we could have a few beers at the end of the day.

We made our way back into Mineral Basin upon arrival, where the sun had already warmed up the snow.   turns were soft and creamy  almost like spring skiing.  We lapped the middle section of Mineral before making the traverse out into the Bookends.  We traversed as far over as we could to skier's right and were able to find some fresh, untouched snow.  We made a few laps here until it was break time.  We sat in the warming shack next to the tram for a few minutes to catch our breath, then went back out into the warm, sunny bluebird day.  We shredded down Shireen to the Black Forest gate to work our way over to the Gad 2 lift.  We went through the gate leading to Thunder bowl and found knee deep snow, although a little chewed up, it proved to be some of the softest turns of the trip so far.   turns were a great work out!  We worked our way down Thunderbowl, picking our lines through the treed up meadow, even finding a few untouched powder fields we were able to access after a little bush whacking.  We lapped this area the rest of the day, never really making the same turns.  It was a phenomenal way to end the day.

Another great thing  besides the knee deep snow days after a storm  is the lift system at Snowbird.  All the chairs are fast, and get you to your destination quickly.  Not too many s can claim this (especially in Utah).

Lastly, if you want to save a few bucks on a lift ticket, visit a local ski shop in Salt Lake and buy a ticket.  You can save up to $10.  We stop by  Lifthouse just at the mouth of Big Cottonwood for our tickets.  This makes skiing at Snowbird affordable.  But once you do a bit of exploring and find where  Good Stuff is, you'll pay any price to get back there.  I know I would.",Richard B
5313,2009-02-02,Utah,Brighton,4,"Brighton is a great little  in Utah, although some would argue that it's just a park rat's .   thing is, you just have to know where to look.

We go to Brighton every time we're in Utah, no matter what the conditions are.  y have great backcountry and fun groomers to rip up if the snow's not that good in the BC.  But at Brighton, the snow rarely ""isn't good"", even days after a storm.  Again, you just have to know where to look.

I can't tell you were to look, you'll have to figure that out yourself.  But let's just say, some of the best snow in Big Cottonwood can be found in and around Brighton.  True, Brighton does advertise itself as a park specific , but you'd be foolish to think that that's all the little  has.  While people go to the other s that aren't so park specific, the hidden snow goes untouched for days until those who are willing to venture for it find it.  That was us.

We found some great, untouched lines at Brighton our last day in Utah.  We were hucking some cliffs into knee deep pow.  We were slashing some turns through wide glades, with the snow hitting us in the chest.  and we were dropping small pillow lines.  All in one day.  Hell, all within one run.  Just go looking for it, but be aware: pay attention to Brighton's signage.  If they say that something it out of bounds or that it's dangerous, they mean it.  You can quickly get in over your head at Brighton if you look too much.

We lapped some BC at Brighton for the first half of the morning, until we couldn't make the big pow turns.  We stopped to cool off at the new Milly lodge.  This place is a great addition: it alleviates the busyness of the other lodge on Brighton, for one, and for two, not many people know of it since it's kind of out of the way, and next to the ""expert's only"" Millicent quad.   food is priced right, too...obviously still spendy, but moderately priced for  food.  Plus, if it is as warm as it was on Saturday, they open up the big doors on the lodge and let the sun  and Mt. Millicent shine in for an awesome view.

 last half of the day we just rocked some groomers to stretch out our legs and cool down for the end of a long and surprisingly powder filled trip.  re were a lot of little kids learning on the front side of Brighton, so take care to mind your turns and be respectful...Brighton boasts great terrain for little rippers to get their legs.  Show them some courtesy! 

One thing of note is how much Brighton's ticket prices have gone up.  In the past year or so, I estimate the tickets have gone up $12.  Stopping by a local ski shop in SLC (such as  Lifthouse) only saves you $3 or $4 off of a ticket.  But, the good part about paying more for heading to Brighton is you can see your money at work: such as the new Milly Quad chair and the new Milly Lodge.

Don't let Brighton slip past you: go check it out.  You won't be disappointed if you just look around...",Richard B

5320,2009-02-03,Minnesota,Spirit Mountain,4,"Well, after the glowing reviews of Spirit Mountain so far this season, it's about time a not so favorable review pops up.  But, it's not Spirit's fault.  It's the weather.  and bad weather for Twin Ports skiing is probably long over due.

 past week has been great skiing for Spirit  almost spring skiing conditions.   temps were in the 30s and 40s, I was told, and made for soft snow.  But 36 hours ago, another deep freeze hit.  It turned that soft, groomed snow into icy concrete.  and that's where the snow has stayed.  Even the best groomers in the world can't bust up that to make it enjoyable.

On top of that, the wind was whipping up the hill off the lake, as it often does at Spirit Mountain.  This blew what little loose snow there was on the hill around into obscure piles around the runs.  Plus, since it was race league night, it only made the turns that much more bitterly cold.  I only made one warm up run, my two race runs, and then one cool down run it was so cold.  My fingers and toes were ice, and my face was so frost bit, it felt like my skin was on fire.

Again, there's nothing wrong with Spirit Mountain *the .*  y are doing everything they can to stay viable in this weird warm up, cool down cycle.  If we can hit temps of 20s again, Spirit will be able to reap the benefits once more of a terrific base (the snow is there, it just can't be groomed when it's frozen solid).

So as much as I hate to say it, wait on the weather if you want to make some turns at Spirit.  Between the boilerplate ice that's passing as ""runs"" right now and the chilly temps, see if you can catch a day this week where a warm up will occur.  n, you'll be back in the Good Stuff that I've showered glowering reviews upon Spirit Mountain before.   snow's there, the weather's not (yet).",hparks
5321,2009-02-03,New Hampshire,Waterville Valley,4,"We skied at Waterville Valley on January 2 on a bad day, with very, very icy conditions on all but the beginner terrain.  We were a mixed ability group that day    everything from beginners to experts    and everyone still had a good time and would be willing to give the area another try with better snow.  Despite the holiday, the lift lines moved quite quickly and the mountain didn't seem too crowded.

5323,2009-02-03,North Carolina,Sugar Mountain,4," I hit all three local s (Appalachian, Beech, and Sugar) on consecutive days, so I think I can give a decent overview of the relative merits of each. I'm pretty much a beginner    my idea doing the three days in a row was to learn how to ski well enough to do any blue trails without busting up too bad (mission accomplished).   black trails can wait for now . . .

I hit Sugar Mountain on a Wednesday, just after a good bit of snow had fallen on the region. Nice sunny day, temps were about perfect for skiing, right under freezing. I could see how people might hate this place if it was crowded. Even on a relatively sparse day, there was some waiting for the main lift (they were only running one up to the summit). Part of the problem is the capacity of the lifts. That main lift takes a looooooong time to get up to the summit (it's a big mt.n, after all). and they only have a double lift, so if they're only running one it's going to back up. If you have to wait in line for a while, you're not going to get that many runs in. Also, as a beginner, I have to say it's much easier to LEARN to ski when the crowds are lighter. So I'd highly recommend trying to hit Sugar in mid week like I did. Lots cheaper and easier. 

That said, I thought conditions in this place were outstanding. I may have been lucky as the weather cooperated. All trails were open. Grooming seemed good. Big Red and Big Birch both had no lines at all for the lifts    did lots of runs on those.  Northridge trail at the summit is really cool, with an amazing view up there. 

My interactions with the staff were pleasant enough.  woman doing lift tickets was poking fun at Beech for not having all of their terrain open. I found a cell phone up on the mountain and turned it into lost and found, and they thanked me for doing that.  only surly person I saw was the cashier at the cafeteria. She just looked like she wanted to go home.   bar was nice, if a bit pricey ($5.50 for a draft Spaten, which only cost $4.00 at Beech). I didn't deal with the rentals there (I rented at Snow Toys in Banner Elk    great guys, much cheaper    highly recommended), so I can't speak to that.

After reading all of the other reviews of Sugar, I'm convinced that the only real problem with the place is that it might be TOO popular, especially on weekends. That, and the pot luck nature of the weather in the NC mountains. I can tell you that I had a great time there and plan on returning.",joe castelli

5341,2009-02-04,California,Kirkwood,4,"I hit Kirwood with friends after/during some serious dump in mid January.  Kirk is definitely my favorite Tahoe Area mountain.  Great terrain and advanced riders will be entertained on the lift that goes to the Wall (don't remember the name) and the Cornice Express.  y take you up into the sky and you can ride steep, open powder on the wall or find yourself some chutes and bowls with sweet double blacks.

 backside was closed due to avalanche control for most of the day, but that may be because they'd had something like 22"" the 24 hours before I got there.  Its a lot of fun when the pow is so deep you can barely turn your board.

I went with 3 advanced riders and we had fun blazing down powder runs and zooming in and out of trees.  Tons of natural jumps and tree runs to play in.

5348,2009-02-05,Virginia,Wintergreen,4,"Overall a really fun place to spend a day.  Great for beginners and intermediate riders, but experts will definitely want something more.  What passes for a double black diamond is more like a blue square, but none the less enjoyable.  Due to the souther location, typically consists of mainly man made snow, which turns slushy around noon, and starts to refreeze around 3 or 4, leaving conditions pretty icey on the steeper slopes.  One major turn off was the lack of a j bar or tow cable for the terrain park, leaving those riders to suffer through the incredibly long lift lines.  Parking was also not too enjoyable.  If you plan on getting a whole day of riding in, get there a little early because you'll probably have to park about a mile away from the slopes (a free shuttle is provided and they are quite frequent).  Have not tried the lodging but the facilities seem to be pretty nice and their are a few nice places to grab lunch as well.",Les
5349,2009-02-05,Utah,Alta,5,"We always visit Alta at least once during our annual trip to Utah.

We got quite a few good shots that are now proudly displayed on our ""ski wall.""  
  is a favorite of my kids' because there is so much terrain to which they have access.  y love the Sugarloaf chair and feel like real hotdog skiers skiing off that chair.  y still enjoy skiing off the Sunnyside Chair and would be happy just skiing that all day.  
We arrived about 20 minutes before the lifts started running on our first visit this trip and there were, no kidding, six other cars in the parking lot.

It stopped early enogh in the afternoon both days for the road down the canyon was clear and easily passable.

5355,2009-02-05,West Virginia,Timberline Mountain,4,"As a native Vermonter I am used to the smaller s that the Mid atlantic has to offer.  Usually the short comings of the terrain are made up for by having a great staff and plenty of amenities.  This was not the case at Timberline.  To begin with the rental shop is poorly organized and many of the employees were just plain rude.  It took almost an hour to get our equipment thanks to understaffing despite the fact that there were relatively few people in line the first day we were there, the second day took even longer.  When we finally did get our skis not only were they out dated, they had not been waxed in ages and we had to pick poles that were mismatched and in many cases badly bent.  
 
  claims to have three lifts, however it counts its bunny slope lift as one of those three so in reality there are only two (only one of which services the top of the mountain). On New Years Eve the lines were manageable, mostly due to poor weather, but on New Years Day the lines for the lift to the top were averaging a twenty minute wait.  Add that to the slow lift speed and you can anticipate around 40 minutes bottom to top for about a 5   10 minute ride down the slopes.   
 
 lodge itself is decent but the service is very poor and the food is nothing special if you plan on eating lunch.  It took around 45 minutes to get a sad looking sandwich and a beer only to have the waitress screw up the bill and in the end add more than she had originally. I will say that the beer is cheap though so if you have someone with you who wants to do the lodge thing it might be a consideration. 
 
Ultimately I can not recommend Timberline to anyone who enjoys a ski vacation, you will be disappointed.  On the other hand WISP is around 35 miles away and is a much better  in every aspect.  ",tc5

I took a friend there to learn to board and his very first time on a lift the operator had to slow it down and told him to ""hurry the h*ll up!"" I couldnt belive it! This place isnt sort of icey at night, its very icey all of the time. y lie on thier website telling you thier snow is nice and the best in years and when you pay the very overpriced price of a lift ticket you realize you have been dooped because there is just massive areas of ice all over this crummy hill. y like to make sure you dont have fun by blocking off anything that they consider ""off trail"" where as in real ski s they let you ski where you want to, on trail or off.  kids that go there are cocky and think they are the best thing ever and like to throw snow at you, cut you off, use a massive amount of profanity as well.  lodge, if thats what you want to call it is also a joke it smells like mildew and if you think that is bad try going into the locker room. its small, crowded, smells just as bad as the bathroom and is full of cocky kids.

5358,2009-02-05,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,4,"Let me first say that I agree with many that Snowshoe has gotten very crowded in recent years.  I've been skiing Snowshoe since the early 90's, and the area has improved a lot since then.  Of course, with those improvements came bigger crowds as well.  But I can't help but shake my head and laugh at all these reviews that complain about the ticket costs in one sentence, followed by complaining about the crowds in the next one.  It's very simple capitalism folks:  supply and demand.  Given Snowshoe's popularity, and the fact its the best  anywhere in a large geographic and population area, of course its going to get crowed (and of course they will be able to charge more for tickets).  If Snowshoe can charge $75 and still pack them in on weekends, what exactly is the problem here?  Obviously people are willing to pay that amount, including yourself, so why bitch and moan about it?  

If anything, charging a higher price helps keeps the crowds down.  Could you imagine how crowded Snowshoe would be if lift tickets were only $25?  It would be a total zoo and everyone would be miserable (and would scream for Snowshoe to raise its prices to keep more people away, especially the rift raft).  I especially love the comparisons of ticket costs out west (that is, the costs out there are about the same).  I'm sure that's the case, but you're comparing apples and oranges here.  Out west, there are plenty of great s around, thus their is a lot of competition amongst the s.  You simply don't have anywhere near that competition in the east (I don't think Snowshoe is all that worried about competition from Ski Beech, for example).  and, we simply have more crowds here as well (more people, smaller s, etc.)  Thus, I don't have much of a problem at all with the price of the lift tickets, as the higher price keeps the crowds relatively in check.  In fact, they should probably consider raising them more for certain weekends and holidays (maybe charge $100 on Presidents weekend, for example).

As for the  itself, again its the very best of the mid atlantic, and you've have to head to New England to experience anything better in the entire eastern U.S.  Getting back to the crowds, I personally avoid Snowshoe on certain weekends and holidays, and stick to weekdays and specific weekends during the year (such as early January, early/late season, etc.)  Overall, if you're looking for a great place to ski without having to fly out west, I'd recommend Snowshoe.  But, check the weather and again, try to avoid popular weekends if possible.  Oh, and if you're an advanced skier/snowboarder, remember that the blacks at Snowshoe are the equivalent to blues out west.  However, the conditions are much better out west and thus easier to ski, so in the end it kind of equals everything out as far as I'm concerned.    ",tc5
5359,2009-02-05,Pennsylvania,Whitetail,4,"Skied Whitetail for the first time on January 4. I was staying with a friend in Southern Maryland who lives only 2.5 hrs away. It was an easy 2.5 hrs. You are off the interstate for about 15 minutes. If you live this close, and can bare the 57.00 lift ticket, it is worth going.

I was pleasantly surprised by the facilities.  lodge is well kept, and was overstaffed with hospitable friendly people in khakis and tucked in polos.  common area, which boasts picnic tables and the cafeteria is equipped with cubbies for you to stash your belongings while you ski. I immediately noticed that many people had brought their lunches. This may be a wise move if you have the whole family.  prices in the cafeteria are exorbitant to the point that it is humorous.  food is not terrible however, and there are a lot of choices. I will also add that the  is dry, so don't count on grabbing a beer with lunch. It would probably be ten dollars anyway. Outside the lodge are ski racks, as well as a free ski check. All of the kids working the ski check were extremely polite, and not grunged out and apathetic.  One of the people we were skiing with said that he had a pair of skis stolen from the rack a few years back, and I have read the same. re is a security guard that patrols the area around the racks, but I am not sure how he is supposed to keep track of 100 skis and faces. Not much of a deterrent. 

From what I have read and heard I expected the mountain to be a madhouse considering it was a Sunday. I guess since families were coming off Christmas break this was not the case.  Although it was more crowded than I would have liked there were no lift lines throughout the course of the day. A ski patrol had told us that the day before was extremely crowded, and this was clearly evident on the slopes. I have to blame the  for the poor conditions. It was clear after the first couple of runs that none of the more difficult trails had been groomed. Pretty much every trail we skied was a field of leftover mini mogul crud. You were able to find some soft man made from the night before, but it confined you strictly to the very edge of each trail. I am a strong to advanced intermediate and found no challenges.  double black is comfortably skied by someone on my level.  re is a great area for beginners off the Easy Rider with one nice long green, and a beginner blue. I think boarders would be happy with the terrain park, which had a lot more features than I had imagined. Numerous jumps, rails, as well as a large quarter pipe. Considering their vertical the trails are long and continuous. It's enough to keep you occupied for a day.

If you are a penny pincher you may feel cheated by the 57.00 lift ticket. I have come to terms with the fact that we live in the Midatlantic and don't have a lot of options. Living in such a limited area (Hampton Roads), any day skiing is a good one. I will admit however that I felt cheated by the lack of grooming, and the condition they left the mountain in from the day before. I will go back to Whitetail when I am close by, and would recommend it for day trips.

5367,2009-02-06,Colorado,Breckenridge,4,"Had a really great trip here   the second for our family of four (me, wife, 2 daughters 10 and 7).  Arrived December 27 and left January 3.   snow this year has been great and the majority of the mountain was open and well covered.  My kids had an excellent ski school experience once again.  I finally got up the courage to ski the Imperial Bowl and it was definitely worth it.  My 15 year old nephew and I lapped that thing probably 5 6 times (different line every time), and then the 6 chair below it 3 times all in one afternoon.   view up there was outstanding, and up to this point the most incredible I have seen in my brief skiing experience.   sky was sooo blue, and the bottom of the mountain looked almost flat.  Incredible fun.

Lines at the Falcon were always short,  but i found those slopes to be pretty icy both afternoons that we skied there, especially Crystal and Centennial.  Though the snow prior to our arrival had been plentiful, we received no fresh snow during the trip. Cimarron was in better condition, and a fun groomed advanced run.  Also, Grits was a fun, short mogul run off of Crystal that made the ice worth it.

So lines at the top weren't bad, but the very bottom was pretty long.  We waited close to 45 minutes at the Independence superchair once, and an hour at Quicksilver super6 another time.  Beaver Run Superchair also had an occasionally long wait, but rarely more than 15 or 20 minutes I would guess.    This was no surprise, given the time of year.  My advice is to stay high on the mountain if you can ski that stuff and you won't have bad lines even at christmas time.  Expect to spend around to $15 for a bowl of chili, a water, and a fountain drink.

Driving into the ski area parking lot, you are distracted and greeted by tons of families parked on the side of the road who have nothing to do with skiing/boarding, especially some who tend to park with parts of their car sticking out into the road. Once up the mountain, at Mt. Baldy's Mid Mountain Lodge, the ""Notch"", skiers have difficulty finding a place to eat the lunch they purchase in the cafeteria because throngs of families have brought up picnic food and occupy all of the cafeteria seats.. On Mt. Baldy's beginner runs, you need to compete for space and dodge these same non ski families who love to simply walk around in the middle of a ski run.

  To break for lunch on a 34 degree afternoon at the mt.. top lunch terrace is to think, ""Ah! THIS! is what it's all about""*  views are amazing, there is terrain for every level, especially blues and blacks. You can een take your try at the 2000 Olympic Downhill run which will get you up to 50 60 mph in about 5 secnds if you can overcome the feeling that you really ought to make a little turn of braking.
  Otherwise there are nice, wide slopes, with many less ""dangerous intersections/bottlenecks"" than you'll find at places like...deer valley. I really do not have the vocabulary to describe what a different experience it is from skiing in the Canyons or Park City. You still sweat your buns off fighting the mountain, but due to ""really being out there on the mountain"", of solitude,  with no city in sight, and possibly no human in sight on the weekdays, (on certain parts of the mountain), you get an ""at peace"" feeling you don't get anywhere else,...not even at Solitude.
  For those who stay in Salt Lake to go to a different Mt. each day, this is one you ought to start and end your trip with because it rapidly became our favorite. Most of the smart locals come here because it is out of the way, with no hotels, condos or nightlife very near. (But you're only 40 minutes from Salt Lake if you have the energy of a college kid, and can find a nice B&B or a room near the mountain if you do a little search or book early.) its an entirely different feeling than Cottonwood Canyon. Wide open, you drive through open mountain roads, a great way to start and end a great day of skiing.
  If you are there with the family, they do have a school, etc. for beginners, but this is really a place more for skiers rather than newbies to the sport. Not that they don't have greens, they certainly do, its just that other places cater to kids and newbies on a deeper level.
  I LIKE Gondolas, esp. in bad weather. se are nice clean gondolas, the views are heartstopping and I meet many nice people from all over the world, and even some locals who are usually happy to guide you to an interesting trail or area you have not yet sought out. You get to take off your skis and stretch, but not for long enough to lose your will to get back out there when the ride up is over. and it can get windy on bad days, so at these times you're even more thankful.
   only bad experience I had is that if there is cloudy weather, it invariably winds up sitting on top of the mountain, right where the main gondola drops you off and you ski blind, unable to see ten feet in front of you. Almost like skiing in a dream of sudden gray quiet, It was scary as all get out the first time, but I wound up challenging myself with a tougher trail than I thought I could handle by accident,...and I did just fine. I then saw what I'd done after it cleared up after lunch and was ever so proud that, ""I skied that one!"". 
   Someone else mentioned they ran into people who seemed not to care.  worst situation I saw is simply that some days not enough employees showed up to run every single lift, and some were complaining at first, but the place is so big, there were still few lines except on the green lift.Most of the people who work there, and are meant to deal with the public, were exceedingly ""Mid Western Nice"", were proud of their Mt. and glad to share stories with me. If you approach someone with a scowl, they probably will not be too warm to you. But if you understand they are dealing with the extremes of mountain weather to try and keep all these machines running, and cut them a break, they will be very helpful.
 This is NOT a hooby where you rent time on a court. se people work hard to give us a place to ski for what is only 6 7 month of the year if they're lucky, and they ARE loathe to give up your money once it is in their coiffers. Can you blame them? But if you behave with class, they will probably issue you a pass if you have a rel incident on your side. y have lockers downstairs in a beautiful lodge with marble tiled, private and clean johns. Everything is carpeted with overstuffed chairs to change on. It looks like a high end hotel spa, just with no hotel and no spa. (Although they do have a higher end restaurant if you don't want to eat with the upper middle class rabble at the food service areas.)  thing is, on the weekends, they run out of lockers. But after 2 days of using a locker, we found most folks just leave there stuff out, (use your head as to what you leave obviously!!), we did the same for an entire week and had nothing touched. Basically, if you can afford to ski, you're not in the market for someone elses smelly shoes or sweat soakes hat they use as an extra. If you are a ""must have a locker type"", try to remember to bring some quarters with you to save time in the morning.n go out and have one of the best days of your trip!
*one thing thats a must. As I mention above, eating lunch on the upper terrace is a treat in itself. But not only are you facing the glorious sun, but you are facing the highest part of the moutain where "" CRazies/Extreme skiers"" get to take a small chair all the way up to the top of this one peak. A peak like Warren Miller uses in his movies. So you get one of three experiences that cannot be beat;
1)You get to watch some truly amazing skiers tame the toughest parts of the ski area.
2) You get to watch overzealous intermediates go way above their level to ""give it a shot"" and hike over to the high crevices and create a fresh trail as they roll or flip their way down the fresh snow.
or
3) You get encouraged by watching the crazies/extreme skiers and go give it shot yourself, wind up rolling and flipping down the mountain in your own personal experience. (Or if you're really lucky you get to do all three as did I.)
  Go here, you will not be sorry. I loathe hats and decals, especially the feeling of paying to advertise someone else's business. I left here with a ski boot coffee mug AND a window decal for my truck. Can I say any more?",Dave Freeman

5395,2009-02-09,North Carolina,Sugar Mountain,3,"This was our (me, wife, and 2 daughters 10 and 7) second trip to sugar mountain, prompted by an unexpected day out of school for the kids on the Friday before MLK weekend.  We arrived LATE Thursday night, founding lodging via phone on the way.  We were lucky and got one of the last couple of 2 bedrooms available close to the mountain (message here is on MLK weekend, better book early).

Friday (our snow day) was bitterly cold, with single digit temps in the morning and the high couldn't have been above 15 or so.  Fortunately, we were ready for it, but still had to take some breaks to warm up.  y were making a lot of snow that day which made for good skiing conditions (no ice), but poor atmosphere.   slopes were not very crowded, and lift waits were brief.  I did ski their double black slope, whoopdeedo, that day.  It was the first day of the season it was open.  It was pretty darn steep, narrow, and short; no moguls as it had just been ""made"" the night before; and pretty icy such that a couple of times I nearly lost edges.  I had a lot more fun on Tom Terrific (single black) due to better snow conditions.  Overall it was a very fun day for everyone.

Saturday was simply too crowded.   snow was good despite the crowds.  No one was skiing the black slopes at the top, but all the rest were dangerously crowded.  In fact, a couple of times, my children (who both ski in excellent control) were nearly knocked over by folks that were completely reckless or out of control.  By 1 o'clock, lift lines at the base were looking about an hour long   and so were the lunch lines   so we decided to call it a day and head for other activities.

My advice, the holiday weekend is crazy crowded with busloads of kids.  I'm sure it is great for the , and keeps them alive year after year.  But, if you have some flexibility, try coming here when the conditions are less crowded.   snow was really great this trip, but I would wait on my decision to ski here until you can get a favorable weather report   unless you don't mind skiing in the rain (see my previous post).  We will definitely be back, and are starting to consider sugar our ""local hill""   though we live 5 hours away in Middle Tennessee.  It seems that timing here is everything!",Kyle Harmon Townsend

5403,2009-02-09,New Hampshire,Loon Mountain,4,"I agree with Loonatic.  I have skied at Loon regularly for 8 9 years. l have had a various season passes for at least 6 years.   South Mountain is a great edition but there has been a clear change in the mountain's attitude.
When Boyne took over all the many familiar staff faces on the mountain disappeared.

re is a clear decline in focus on the skier/guest.  For new and young skiers there was comfort in knowing that a yellow jacketed ambassador could be found anywhere on the mountain.  In the past two years I can ski a full day and see 5 if I am lucky.  Season pass holders have had pass benefits reduced every year.   blackout dates on the silver and bronze passes are changed year to year with no rhyme or reason.   discount for a passholder on blackout days is still higher than skiing at an other hill for the day.    Cost of food remains a bit high, and from a value perspective, no longer feels like it is worth the premium.

In contrast, on a recent black out day we went to another ""hill"" off of Rt 93 and had a great day.   ambassador who we met in the parking lot, found us in the lodge during lunch and gave us free passes to come back another day.
This would never happen at Loon.

5404,2009-02-09,Wisconsin,Whitecap Mountain,2," We spent 3 days skiing at White Cap this January.  We purchased the 3 day Slalom package that included rentals, lodging, 3 breakfasts, 2 dinners, 3 ski lessons and lift tickets for 3 days.  This was our first time skiing so we took advantage of the ski lessons that came with the package.   lessons were good and we enjoyed the vast variety of beginner runs on the mountains.  However, the skiing and the lessons were the only good thing about WhiteCap.   accommodations (we stayed in a 2 bedroom chalet in the Sarajevo building) were outdated and very modest.   beds were very uncomfortable and the living area left much to be desired.   breakfast at WhiteCap was comparable to low quality institutional food and consisted everyday of greasy potatoes and eggs.   one dinner we had was acceptable, but we did not even get to have our second dinner in our package because the dining room was closed.  When we brought this to the attention of one staff member, he attempted to accommodate us, but his attempts were thwarted by another employee who pretty much told us we were out of luck and gave us directions to a nearby town for dinner.  Another downside was that the bar and wine hut that WhiteCap advertises on its website was never open during our stay there.  Overall, we would recommend going to WhiteCap for the day to enjoy the skiing, but would not recommend staying at the  as it is clearly rundown and mismanaged.",winstonwolf

5422,2009-02-12,Wisconsin,Cascade Mountain,5,"I'm an advanced skier, so read this with that in mind. If you are a beginner or have never skied before, then this is the place to go. However, don't be fooled in to thinking that you can ski ""blacks"" if you ski a black (or even a blue) at Cascade. A simple trip out west to a real mountain will show you what real blacks and what real blues are.

 Good:

If you're nearby and need to get some skiing in, go here: it's decent, and when you get bored of the easy runs then you won't feel like you've traveled too far. If you want to teach a beginner, especially kids, then go here: kids ski free and the terrain is very easy (see below). 

 bad: 

Ok   Let's get one thing straight: this is a ""mountain"" for beginners. Calling it a mountain is generous too. If the runs were to be based off of and compared to the runs out west (Colorado, Utah, etc.), then the entire mountain would be a green, with the exception of perhaps 2 runs being easy blues, and one run qualifying as an easy black (the mogul run).  lift lines were long when I went. Moreover the lifts themselves are incredibly slow (with the exception of the Mountain Express which was always packed). Thus, waiting in line and taking the lift to the top was on average about 10 minutes. Skiing down a ""fast"" run takes about 30 seconds. Repeating this process all day gets very frustrating. If you go at night, then you can get better timing by just taking the Express chair up. However, if you're advanced you'll soon become bored easily. 

In sum, for an advanced skier, this place is just to scratch an itch  nothing more. Cascade may be good if you just need to warm up for a trip out west. I would recommend going at night to avoid the crowds. Otherwise you'll spend all day in lift lines looking at people with blue jeans stuffed into rear entry boots.",J
5423,2009-02-12,Wisconsin,Wilmot Mountain,4,"I don't see it as a mountain but a little higher hills.  Some black runs are steep, but require only two turns before you reach the bottom.  I rather drive up 30 more mins. to Alpine Valley, where runs are A LITTLE better. ",J

5431,2009-02-13,California,Sierra at Tahoe,4,"I am an avid snowboarder   have been for over 15 years! I've been to places like Heavenly, Squaw, Boreal, Arapahoe, Breckenridge, etc. and this place has a little something for everyone weather you are a beginner, intermediate or expert. It does tend to get a little crowded on weekends and it is somewhat agitating when there are people just sitting around on the slopes (especially ones that are too advanced for their skills) but that's to be expected at any ski . This is where I first learned to ski and snowboard, and it will probably be up there as one of my favorites (along with Arapahoe). 

Be weary however that though the conditions are oftentimes great, when they are not it does tend to get extremely icy and not for the feint of heart, nor the inexperienced. All in all a great place to take your family, friends, or enjoy the sites that Northern California has to offer. ",alvlee01
5433,2009-02-13,California,Dodge Ridge,4,"I've lived in the area all my life and have been skiing or boarding at Dodge for over twenty years. My family also used to rent a condo in Tahoe every winter when I was growing up, so I'm familiar with more than my own backyard. While the snow season at this elevation is sporadic, the snow can still be downright phenomenal every so often. Today was a great example. On a saturday, there were no lift lines, hardly anyone on the hill, and fresh powder up to two feet deep. Granted, it was snowing... all day, which kept all but the heartiest riders at home. I am a very accomplished skiier and can comfortably handle any terrain, and yet I have never grown tired of barrelling down a great intermediate run at break neck speeds, and Dodge has plenty runs just perfect for this. If you like hitting the same spot over and over with minimal lift riding, Dodge won't be your favorite. You have to take more than one lift typically to traverse the mountain to get to certain spots. This never bothered me, however. But if you're uptight and used to micromanaging everything in your life, including your recreation, this will probably annoy the heck out of you. My only gripe is how expensive the prices have gotten. Gone are the midweek specials like ""2 for Tuesdays"".  cheapest season pass purchased pre season is $350, which might have been even higher than Heavenly this year. But you know... whatever the market will bear. re are plenty crappy snow days at Tahoe, too. I was there between Christmas and New Years, and what a nightmare. re was a substantial storm the day before I arrived in South Shore, and yet within days Heavenly was losing snow and showing rocks EVERYWHERE. and I spent 4.5 hours in a traffic jam in the PARKING LOT of Sierra at Tahoe. and the conditions were NOT great! So for everyone thrilled with Tahoe's traffic jams, INSANE ticket prices, rude riders and worse staff, KEEP IT! We hillbilly's think Dodge is chill and fine just the way it is.",chris  Bjornmose

Furthermore, there were no interesting runs, and in order to reach some of the runs, you'll need to traverse flat, if not slightly uphill, terrain.

BUT: everything else in Summit County is connected by the Colorado or Epic passes, so the marginal cost of a day at Copper is relatively high for holders of those passes. and if you go into the towns and sit at the bars or restaurants, it seems that the vast majority of people have those passes. So Copper gets left out, which probably doesn't matter much to Intrawest, but it hurts all of the stores in the Village. It's great to find a super mountain that's as empty as Copper, but you have to wonder whether or not Copper can stay viable when most of the people who ski Summit County have a marginal cost of zero when they ski Breck, Keystone, ABasin, Vail, or Beaver Creek, but have a $92 upfront charge to go to Copper.",Les

Big Birch and Northridge to Upper Flying mile were our favorite runs. y also had snow machines on during out night session one evening so the conditions were much better than earlier in the day.  mountain was challenging enough but especially great for beginners.  extremely slow magic carpet in the beginners area is a great motivation to learn quickly to get to faster chairs.  bus to/from the parking lot was very quick and convenient if you can't park up close and parking is FREE which is not always the case we learned at other ski s such as Appalachian ($1 parking, Hawksnest $3).  food was ok but not anything like Appalachian.

5469,2009-02-16,North Carolina,Ski Beech Mountain,4,"Ski Beech is the penultimate example of mediocrity at it's finest. It's not a bad place, per say, but my total indifference to my experience there tells me that it's just a boring place worth avoiding in general.  best thing about it is the high speed quad that runs you to the top makes for a pretty quick ride to the top.  terrain park is worse than App's but slightly better than Sugar's, the black diamonds are fun when the conditions aren't too icy, otherwise they are really lame. Another great thing is that if you go during the week, not only are there some great specials on lift tickets (ladies ski free day, half off day passes, etc.) but there are also little to no lift lines. If you're looking for a bargain, and don't feel like spending half your day on the lift (cough cough Sugar cough), maybe Beech could be a good idea.

5474,2009-02-16,Michigan,Swiss Valley,5,"Swiss is my home ""mountain"" so i've been riding there for the past 6 years. Mark does a great job with the space and snow he has for building the park. Rails are always smooth and the jumps are great this year. Swiss can get abit icy after 5pm, so keep that in mind, but its still a great place to spend the afternoon. Most of the locals are friendly but there are a large number of young kids if you come on a ski club night. Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and aside from one drunk liftie, i've never had a problem there. Highly recommended based on its location in respect to mishawaka/south bend riders, but may not be exactly what your looking for if your used to bigger slopes.",J
5482,2009-02-16,Wisconsin,Granite Peak,4,"Our family spent 3 nights during Christmas break last year.  I've heard some bad things about this place before I go, but that was a joke except the ticket price.  Ticket at booth was way expensive, but I found out that there're several ways to save $$; order online in advance, weekdays multiday tickets are really steal, and look for adult and child combo tickets.  

First of all, we never waited in line for lifts.  Not crowded at all.   groomer was going around during the day time.  It was really cold but one of the days was POWDER DAY!!  It was GREAT all day long!   Blacks were really blacks at Garnite Peak (unlike other places).  Awesome!   All staffs showed their professionalsm.  

 downside is that the HWY 39 was horrible.  We travelled from Chicago.  It was OK until Portage (90/39), but after the split, roads were icy and only one lane was cleaned.  

In overall, it's worth the visit for a longer stay.",shari ann
5483,2009-02-04,Pennsylvania,Jack Frost,4,"Went to Jack Frost for a 2 day trip.  We stayed at a nearby inn.   location is very convenient for those coming up from Philly.    generally does a very good job of keeping its terrain in top shape, and it lived up to that reputation during our visit.   problem we did encounter is that Jack Frost get shit by high winds which tend to blow the snow off the mountain by late in the afternoon, so shoot for mornings when you visit.

Now for the downside.   price and quality of the food offered in the lodge was simply the worst I have ever experienced at any mountain.   staff in food services is unprofessional and will do anything they can to avoid helping you.   staff treated ketchup like a luxury, and no one seemed to know where they could find any to fill the empyt dispensers.  If you visit here be ready to pony up a lot of money for a really lousy lunch if you want to eat on the mountain.

A problem most of the Penn s have is a lack of varied terrain, this shouldn't come as a suprise to anyone who has visited them.  This isn't really something you can blame on Jack Frost, it's simply the restrictions of the surrounding mountains, which are closer to large hills.

Finally, one of the couples in my party had to rent skies, boots and poles.  Even by rental standards the equiptment was lousy.  I would recommend getting some rentals off the mountain.",resa 1
5494,2009-02-17,Vermont,Sugarbush,2," valley, including Mad River Glen and Sugarbush, offers the best and most complete ski experience in the east.  Sugarbush offers everything from well groomed trails for skiers who want to cruise to classic eastern steeps, glades and natural terrain.   trails, local roads (no traffic lights) and villages (there are two) are uncrowded and charming.   owner is a local and his care for the place is plain to see . . . you can find him directing traffic in the parking lot or on lift lines.  Lift lines are non existent on weekdays and modest on weekends.  

Mad River Glen significantly adds to the valley.  It's a must unless you're either boarder or just starting out.  Ski it on a weekday though as the weekend lines tend to be long.     ",offwallstreet

5499,2009-02-17,Utah,Powder Mountain,5,"We are from California.  Skiing/boarding over there is not the same as here in Utah, especially Powder Moutain.

This is an awesome place.  Powder everywhere.  Trails are wide and long, especially on the backside.  Hardly anyone was there, so there was no wait for lifts.  People are very nice and courteous.  Staffs are friendly.

Food is very reasonable.  Hamburger is $5.  A cup of chili $4.50.  Sweet Fries $3.  Where do you find this kind of pricing at ski s?  None, that I have been to.

 only downsides are there are limited number of lifts and parking.  Parking area is a bit confusing.  re are three areas to park (top, middle and bottom of the mountain).  When we got there, we saw the first parking lot which was at the bottom of the .  re were hardly any cars.  After gearing up, then one person was nice enough to recommend us to go to the middle area.  Our recommendation, park at the top or the middle parking lot.

5504,2009-02-18,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"While it has a reputation as an ""intermediate mountain"", there are lots of places for those looking for a challenge. Chair 6, the E Chair, Imperial, and the t bar provide access to some really good terrain, and those chairs don't get used by the less adventurous, so even on weekends there are relatively short lift lines there. Fortunately, Breck gets somewhat more snow than its neighbors, so those tougher areas are usually available and ungroomed   Breck saves most of its grooming for the greens and blues. and it's a real town, not a made for the mountain community, so there are a lot of choices for eating, renting equipment, and shopping.

Tree skiing is everywhere and that is alsome.  One thing that you must have is plenty of water which makes camelbacks a must have.

5516,2009-02-18,Minnesota,Welch Village,5,"I took my daughter and her friend to Welch for their first time out. This would be my second time this year. 

One thing that I like about Welch is that it is a bit farther out from the cities than other ski areas. and thus there are fewer people to go there when the weather is a bit iffy or if it is a bit colder.  Hmmm, ignore that last little bit, the place is REALLY BUSY all the time. 

Welch recently opened a new ""Back Bowl"". To get there for the first month you need to be a season pass holder. Which can include the Freeze Pass, which is what I bought. It allows you to get a regular ticket for $15 off. and it only costs $30. 

 back bowl is all Black or Double Black diamonds and it reminds me of out west. Just a LOT shorter. But, fun none the less. Since the area is closed to pass holders, there were not that many people back there. So, I was able to  get a lot of runs in. It seemed like after 8 to 10 runs my legs would get tired so I would head back to the front side. 

Since there were not that many people out there the day we went, I was able to get in a whole bunch of runs. Probably close to 60 to 70. For the most part, I was able to ski down and get right on the lift.  runs were all groomed well and were not all that icy, even late in the day. 

My daughter and her friend had a great day as well, they even went on a Black Diamond run. 

 only thing that I really have a problem with is the cost of food. and that there are no free refills on soda.  bowl of chili I had was pretty good but with an order of fries and a soda it came to almost $10. But I did get free sour cream with the chili. 

One nice bonus, and it was unexpected, is that the main bathroom had heated floors.

If you wanna network with hollywood or wallstreet go to Aspen mountain.  If you wanna ski great vertical, hike the bowl at highlands.

As far as the Apres Scene it could be alot better. 

As far as night life, great choice of restaurants,  re are a good choice of bars but not enough local music sans cover..  ZZ top at the Belly Up for $250 just dosen't fit into my budget. granted they do have other decently priced shows and do pull in some great names. and a big plus because I think the bar staff's big attitude seems to have gone back to San Diego and they are slowly coming back to the funky mountain town vibe the double diamond had.

yes it's Aspen and it's expensive but there are deals to be had.  Don't let the ego trickle down get you....

However, I didn't see the big deal over a gondola.  re was knee deep fresh powder, which was great to ski through.   slopes were nice and wide yet also presented a challenge for every skier.

On our first visit we fell in love with the area and the . staff is professional and friendly.  lodging options offer a wide array of opportunities and budgets. We meet delightful guests while on the lifts, in the lodges, and out in the evening.We have increased our visits from 1 week to 2 and 3 weeks and moved our company planning and board meetings to Vail.
My husband and I have been skiing since high school and our daughter since she can walk. We are all accomplished skiers.  ski instruction at Vail is unsurpassed (we have logged over 500 hours in instruction over the years). Specifically, Erik Hartman, our instructor for the past 3 years pinpoints and addresses slight details that have increased our enjoyment and competence tremendously. He has also showed us places to ski that we did not know existed. 
Our favorite nightlife is Mickey's Lounge at the Lodge at Vail. Micky is a wonderful pianist who makes every visitor feel welcome and want to return repeatedly   for the music as well as the man.. After a great day of skiing in the trees and bumps we enjoy some apre ski refreshments at several Vail establishments. Each has a different atmosphere and each has great people.

5539,2009-02-18,Vermont,Killington,3,"I've been here maybe ten times in the last 5 years, so this is not a review from a sole visit. Whether you're a family or a fraternity member, you will find other's of your ilk to play or speak with. y have really notched up the excellent snowmaking in recent years, but they use this to fudge numbers on occasion and if you are looking for the true conditions, either email or look for local blogs for the truth.
  That said, unless you are looking for private quiet moments, you will find anything else you would expect from a ski holiday right here.  Hotels and restaurants of every stripe, (An evening, esp. for families, eating at "" Garlic"" is a must!  best Garlic filled Italian food you will find outside of NYC!) y are really pushing the  as a year round vacation spot these days and it shows in the quality of nicer lodging built in recent years. But they still cater to skiers. Most places include a hearty, early morning breakfast with your room price, and you can eat and catch the reliable shuttle to the slopes to get there by 8 9a.m. with no problem. You cannot expect Utah or Colorado conditions on the east coast. But for the climate they have, they do the best job they can and have been adding more runs each year to try and break up the crowds a bit.  lift lines, esp. on weekends and holidays, can be long unless you know which parts of the Mountain to go to, (which usually requires you to be an intermediate or preferably better skier to get there and stay there to enjoy your day.)  worst part is the out of control 14 24 year old snowboarders trying to keep up with friends who have more experience. y strip the snow off the slopes and more than once I have been cut off or actually hit by a kid, most do not even take the time to apologize or yell out ""sorreeee!"" as they blow past while cutting you off. So it is imperative to keep an eye out on the more crowded slopes.
   Once you learn the MT, it makes things a bit easier to navigate and there are tricks and shortcuts to learn all over the place that will help you. Some locals are over protective, but most realize their economy relies on your vacation dollars and are willing to help you out with good advice.  snow can seem like you are skiing in slow mo compared to the west, but you are in the east, aren't you? re can be icy conditions if there's been no recent snow, especailly where trails meet or there are sharp turns on the novice slopes, but if you can learn to ski on ice, it makes you a better skier on the snow overall. Just don't plan on diggin in to make any sharp turns, because you can't. I think they should look towards having a snowboarders only mountain within the next 5 10 years. This would make the ski experience a bit more pleasant.
    Beginners should also look at the map before heading up to see which slopes may be closed so they don't get trapped on a tougher slope than they care to be on, especially if caught it the confusion of a snowmaking effort which is like skiing in a bad dream with little vision as to whats in front of you. Experts would be best off looking for other experts or preferably a local. y get to the Mt early as they can and ski until 1 2 p,m, when the snowboarders have ruined the slopes and are packing the busy areas like schools of guppies. Killington is also one of the few ski areas where I try to put my gear in a locker. I have had nothing stolen yet, but the feeling it can happen is there. A good idea is to trade a ski with your partner when you break so the pairs are mismatched while you eat or drink.
   Although not as rural as Mt. Snow, nor as family oriented as, say, Okemo, there are still plenty of things to do for skiers and non skiers alike. you can find instruction for a number of winter sports or climbing or snowmobiling, tubing, shopping and much local and interesting history if you are not one who cares to ski. Food on the Mountain is expensive like at any ski area, but is decent. Not great, but decent. there are plenty of Apres ski and happy hour opportunities everywhere you look, and can get quite crowded on weekends and holidays, esp. when there is live music, which there usually is.  choices or places to eat are virtually endless, and most are pretty good too. But ask locals for the best of whatever cuisine you are looking to for to eat the best.
  I must say, although I can see they are trying to improve, they may be going heavy on the on  building unless they can build enough new runs to cut down on some of the overcrowding, or stop selling tickets once they sell a certain # as they do at places like Deer Valley. But with the shorter season here, this will never happen. so as a result, you can feel more like a number than a guest at times. But as the sport grows and more areas or runs are built, hopefully this will change.
  Everything is certainly here, in place right now, for an entire family or ""crew of friends"" to have a great time. You just need to learn the ropes in order to take advantage of the best they have to offer so you can maximize your enjoyment. If you are strictly looking for a quiet family trip, however, go to Okemo.
 One terrible difference between the east and west is the following. Someone backed up into my brand new Tundra in the parking lot at "" Garlic"" my fave. Killington eatery. A guy from the bar took the plates down of the person who hit and ran, but I truly believe that out west, there is a much greater chance the person who hit me would have stopped or left a note themselves.
   Killington is still one of the largest areas in the east. and if you cannot go out west, it is definitely worth a look see. Just keep the above caveats in mind and you'll be fine. We stayed at "" Inn of the Six(?) Mountains"" (7 Mts.)? right near the mountain and it was full of people wanting to get in a full day of skiing and was clean and convenient, if a little noisy.  For entire families or groups of friends, there are plenty of stores around, and condos to rent for the week or weekend do abound and may be your best bet to keep the costs down. and if things are slow, it is definitely worth a call to the mountain itself to try and talk yourself into the best deal you can get for yourself. and if you are flying or driving, (but especially flying) it may be more cost effective to rent skis than to bring your own. and if you're renting for a group, you can usually get yourself a great deal. For college kids, there is pizza delivery and its not half bad. You can buy beer at the local markets all over the place if thats your game too. nothing like a beer in the hottub and the end of a long day of ruining the slopes for us skiers with your poor snowboarding techniques! : ) Just teasing",spack

5546,2009-02-18,Vermont,Stratton Mountain,5,"Stratton is the go to destination for a real weekend ski trip.  ir lift and lodging packages are pretty reasonable, and you can get some awesome deals during early or late season.  On a good snow day, there are enough trails to keep everyone happy:  straight shot steeps, windy twisty roller coaster trails, some gentle cruisers, even some mogul runs that are fun when they get all slushy in the spring.  

I'm super impressed with Stratton's snowmaking and grooming.  Some of the trails can get icy, but I've always been able to find at least a few trails with some snow cover.  On one late season trip the temps were up to the low 50's, yet overnight Stratton's grooming team transformed a muddy, slushy mess into a respectable spring conditions snow cover.  

 village is another plus for Stratton, though it is way too small at the moment.  I love being able to ditch the car and just walk everywhere.  That said, the restaurants range from fair to mediocre, and there is really only one bar that's open after the lifts close, so you can get bored of this stuff fast.  ",wespac187

Devils Head was by far the best.  re is a nice mix of runs.  No wait for lifts.  While lifts are on the slow side, with no wait you are back skiing with minimum delay.  Great variety of runs.  My wife and I stayed on the long Green runs and made forays to the Blue slopes.  Son worked his way up to black diamond slopes.  Runs were not crowded so you didn't have to worry about running into people or being run down.  We loved the long runs in comparison with Alpine Valley and Wilmont.  Snow quality about the same as as Alpine Valley and WIlmont, although pretty good considering a recent thaw and no natural snow for weeks.

Restaurants were uncrowded and food decent to good.  Only downside was that we got bumped from the ""fancy"" restaurant to the perfectly fine alternative.  It as great that cafeteria and other spots were relatively uncrowded.

Finally, staff was great.  From the restaurant to the rental shop to the lift operators they were friendly and helpful.  I really felt that I was in good hands.  I also notice that there were plenty of people working on fixing things up.  re appears to be a real effort to keep the place up.

5556,2009-02-19,Missouri,Hidden Valley,2,"Have been going to this place since the early 90's about once a year.  Usually take the middle school youth group from my church.  Usually do all night skiing which is a bit less crowded than daytime skiing.  This year however went in the daytime  last Saturday actually.  It reached a high of about 70 degrees!  Actually was not bad skiing.  A little slushy and got a little icy as the day went on.  By far the warmest skiing I have ever done  spent the entire day in a T shirt, no gloves.

This is not that bad of a place if you live in the St. Louis area.  Not a place I would drive a long distance to.  Very small although since they opened the back hill and it's ski lift, it is much better.  Also, the new ski rental building which was actually added probably 6 8 years ago make ski rental a lot faster than it was in the past.  Ski equipment is fairly new and kept in good shape.

Anyway, this is not a bad place to spend a day of skiing locally, although tends to be a lot of beginner skiers which can sometimes be dangerous because they don't know what they're doing and can cut you off.  One thing bad is there is no ""medium"" ski runs serviced by chairlift.  Once you go up the chairlift it can be fairly difficult for the inexperienced skier.  and the ski school guides don't even take you up the chairlift.

 one bad thing about this place is that on the main middle run ""Lauren's Lane,"" which runs between the two main chairlifts, there are numerous penetrations through the snow  water pipes mainly (from the snow making devices I assume), and the ski lift towers themselves  that are not protected in any way.  Nor are they even blocked by warning signs or orange fences.   ski lift towers do have the normal padding on them but they only reach to about the mid chest of an adult.  If you actually hit one of them head on you would still slam your head into the steel tower.  I'm very surprised that no one has been seriously injured over the years because of this (maybe they have).

Nice clean indoor lodge.  Food is good but very overpriced but that is expected.  A normal 20 oz., $1.00 bottle of soda was $2.50!  Very nice drive to this place  surrounded by million dollar homes.

I understand they are planning another expansion which should make it even better, but the location, lower Midwest, makes for a short ski season.  We don't get a lot of snow here anymore and tend to have unusually mild days during winter months in recent years.  It's usually man made snow at this place but not really all that bad.",J
5557,2009-02-19,Missouri,Snow Creek,3,"So when I went half the terrain park was shut down due to hot weather but from what I can see was well put together and would of been a blast. Down side I had several poor customer service experiences. One was with the GM. He was completely disrespectful  and when I wrote him an email explaining what had happen he replied being very sarcastically rude ""snarky"" in his so called ""apology.""  For that it makes it hard to repect that place and I wonder how many others he is like this with. Other than this decent runs and good terrain park.",J
5558,2009-02-19,Utah,Brian Head,4,"I went to Brian Head on Christsmas Day 2007. Went with the wife and family, and we all had a great time. It was my first time snowboarding, and I was hooked after my first run. I stuck to the beginner trails in the morning, and hit the intermediate stuff after lunch.  beginner trails had a lot of flat spots where I lost all my momentum (largely due to being a beginner I'm sure) but the intermediate runs were awesome. Tons of powder, to the point where on my last run I turned a bit too much to the left and hit a snowpile no one had touched all day, fell down and got stuck up to my waist in powder. ate lunch at the buffet, good stuff for a decent price. All the staff I encountered was very friendly. Can't wait to go back!",Karen

5561,2009-02-19,Minnesota,Lutsen Mountains,4,"Just got back from Lutsen 2 days of skiing, we ended up staying in Silver Bay Americinn for the price and the water slide, it was a nice hotel, kept clean and updated,slide was alot of fun.  drive up to Lutsen could be too long for more than 2 days. Thanks to 5 in of new snow the day/night before we skied the skiing was good, just a bit icey under the new snow but very happy with conditions,seems it might have been getting a little tough before the new snow with some minor bare patches and tops of rocks exposed in the trees, got to try the new ""Plunge"" which was fun and exciting for Mn skiiing very steep and really tough on the 2 day when all the fresh snow was skiied/blown off with ice exposed, there is a long flat run off at the bottom that keeps you from taking too many runs down. Mystery and Moose held the snow the best,eagle mountain gets skiied out pretty fast ,also something must have gone wrong when they made snow for the moguls on Hari Cari and Grizzly runs because they are all chunky and pretty much unskiable so if you like moguls that could be a dissapointment for you.

5575,2009-02-20,Michigan,Schuss Mountain,5,"We greatly enjoyed our trip to Schuss Mountain.   3 days of snowfall resulted in excelland skiing conditions.  We found that we could ski onto the lift or had very short waits most of the weekend except during the 11 4 hours, when many of the local folks used special deals to enjoy the mountain.  Even then, the wait was only a minute or two.   slopes were never terribly crowded on Schuss Mountain once you got off of the very top part of the mountain where all of the lifts met.

I thought the staff was very friendly a pretty patient even when he crowds came.  I really enjoyed the night skiing and they had bonfires along several of the slopes where you could rest in chairs and warm up.  

Special kudos to the rental people who were patient with my family as they picked and returned different peices of equipment.  I appreciated the fact that Katie (I think that was her name) took the time at 9:30 p.m. on Saturday night to pick through the available ski boots to find a dry pair for my daughter.   guys in the ski shop were great in letting me demo several boards amd fixing up my sons's at minimal charge.

I enjoyed the music that they played at the lifts (even some 80's stuff for the older crowd).  I also liked the fact that most of the lifts ended up in the same place at the top of the Schuss Mountain, which made keeping track of family pretty easy.

We rented a condo at Schuss Moutnain which was a little beat up.   kitchenette was pretty small which is the only complaint my wife had.  We did have one baseboard heater that did not work.  We called and a service person was over within a few hours, but it did not appear that they fixed the problem.  Nonetheless, the heat was not a problem.  re were several units that faced the bunny slope that appear to be in poor condition, including one that had a large sheet of plastic pulled over the porch.  Overall, our unit was okay but it, like the rest of the Schuss Mountain part of the  is looking a little frayed.  However, I will say that we were able to stay there and ski for about 1/3 of the cost of our trip to Boyne Highlands.  Also, it was very convenient to get to and from the slopes.

 Cedar River Lodge, on the other hand, looked like it was in great shape.  We did not got to Summit Mountain, so I can't comment on that.  

I would highly suggest sking the slopes over by the red lift, especially when Schuss Mountain gets crowded.   down side of having all of the lifts dumping out on top of the mountain is that there a lot of people there and the beginning of the runs can get a little backed up.  When we went over to red lift, there were fewer crowds.  Also, the runs by the red lift, although shorter, offfer a more woodsy, isolated feel.

My son really enjoyed the terrain park.   had two terrain park runs, one for beginners and one for experts.  He also loved the heated indoor and outdoor pool.

I can't really comment much on night life.  y had a band Sunday night but not many people there.   dining facility looked more upscale than other parts of Schuss.   service was prompt and friendly and they refilled our chips without charge.  We went to bed about ten so we probably missed most of whatever night life they had.  But I would guess the  caters more to budget concious families and locals.

We will go back again for a long weekend but will try to get a nicer unit.  I can't give 5 stars because of the wear and tear at Schuss reception area and in the condo units but it was a very solid 4.

It was also bitterly cold with a pretty gusty wind so most of my friends didn't last too long.  On the day that we went, the conditions weren't ideal for beginners, the trails were very hard packed, not quite icy but not ideal for a beginner.  However, they were making snow at the top of the mountain with one snow maker.  Also since we were there in the afternoon, the sun was setting and the whole mountain had a shadow casted over it so it was really hard to see the terrain, it was really had to tell if the trail was going to be steep or flatten out.   park is pretty decent more for intermediates.  Big features for jibbing.  Overall I had an enjoyable time, but next time I go I'm going to check that wind chill.",joancoburn

5579,2009-02-20,Vermont,Bolton Valley,4,"For the mountain and what it offers Bolton Valley is a great value.  Wilderness & Timberline line lifts takes you off the main trails and away from the masses. If you know where to go there are some great powder stashes. Don't be afraid to ask an instructor, where to go to find some great woods trails. ",Maureen
5580,2009-02-20,Vermont,Smugglers' Notch,2,"We were there on amazing conditions,  terrain is pretty nice with plenty of options for everyone. One thing to note is that I was there on presidents week and that's a very busy week in ski  but somehow the crowd were dispersed everywhere in the slopes, the lines were not bad at all each line was a minute or 2 not long,  one thing is that they only have doubles lifts but they work fine in this  somehow you get to the very top of this  very fast. I was actually going to Stowe and got lost and ended up in Smuggs (don't ask how Stupid navigation system told me to go in a road that was closed in the winter) but anyway I don't regret a bit that we ended up here, we had a blast, great glades great blues and some fun blacks. For the money this  is great much cheaper than Stowe and you are going to have a blast, but then again we were there on 3 feet of new snow a week before. Food is ok nothing majorly good, but nothing bad, cheap. and the lift ticket it self if cheap considering the s around it.

Temps had been up near 40 a few days before so conditions were not ideal. I read the snow report that morning before we left and the website said they had received  5 in of new snow, so I thought we might get some pretty good riding. Probably one of the most dishonest snow reports I have ever read, there might have been an inch or two of fresh surface. and to top it off the entire upper mountain was closed. I guess you get what you pay for.",Maureen
5582,2009-02-20,Vermont,Okemo Mountain,5,"Just spent a weekend at Okemo and the skiing was great.  trials were well groomed as always and we were able to let them run all over the South Face. Took in the glades on Outrage, Loose spruce and Forest Bump. If you stay to the right on Forest Bump we were able to ski in about 18 inches of untouched powder that nobody seams to know is there. 

 one down side to South Face is there are no facilities other them some rather nasty emergency use only out houses. y would do weel if they could drop a warming hut or waffle hut at the bottom by the lift.

 skiing was just great probable will be one of the top five days this year, not crowded, not windy, sunny but cold. We were able to get in about 12 runs, little to no icy patches. ",mjurkiewicz

5589,2009-02-20,Idaho,Schweitzer,4,"I first rode Schweitzer two days ago, will be spending my winter here, and am very pleased with all the great terrain. Lots of vertical means the runs last a long time. If you ride the t bar you can get a great long run with lots of trees, deep stashed, and few people. If you like a  feel this is a good mountain for you, lots of things going on in the village. y also charge for the shuttle bus, not cool. I would recomend driving up the mountain, but if you want to park close you need to pay $15, also not cool. To not pay to park you have to park on the fall line lot, which unloads you at the bunny hill and you have to wait in long lines to access the main lifts.  mountain and the town seem to have alot of traffic, I feel like I am back home in Minneapolis somt.imes driving around. Overall I like the mountain and the city of Sandpoint, but if the mountain was not kick ass the negatives would keep me away in the future. I guess I just miss Brundage. ",SweetSki

Even though the lifts are not the modern high speed type, the lack of lift lines still leaves plenty of time to get in as many runs as you please.  base area is small with the day lodge, ski shop and ski school all together so letting the kids ski by themselves is ok.   prices are great compared to the larger s and the town of Leadville has some good restaurants and shops.

re are no traffic lights in town, and no chain stores or restaurants... and that's the way the locals like it.
A free shuttle takes you from town to the hill and back, and personally I like staying in town more with all the places to eat and drink... (Ski in/out is just not THAT important to me, nice as it is).  Besides the shuttles run every 15min or so.
and town really has character.  You see locals biking with their skis to the bar (or nordic skiing to the bar), picking up their mail at the Post office, or just hanging out talking with each other.

 skiing is unreal.   steeps are some of the steepest terrain I've ever skied inbounds, and corduroy can still be found at the end of the day... powder stashes can be found 3 4 days after a dump, and the town opens late for powder days...  Teocalli Tamalie has a poster board from this year and last showing its delayed openings / powder days!   US Freeskiing championships were in town while I was, and the party on the hill was not to be believed!  People grilling, sitting in lawn chairs, (this is on the top of the hill, accessible by taking the T bar up!)   mountain set up a beer tent, with all proceeds going to the Adaptive Sports Group (taking disabled people out to play)...
Wow.  Can't wait to see what Mardi Gras brings!  (this town LOVES to party!) 

and its just not skiing on the hill that's fantastic, but the backcountry (complete with guide service) must be skied to be believed. 

On full moons, there is a Nordic ski or snowshoe trip to a hut for dessert (and also one for brunch that did not do)
If you need to give your ski legs a break, I'd def. try out the miles of cross country trails...

However, as great as the skiing is, the people here are even better... always friendly, happy, and willing to part with locals knowledge, such as if you sit at the bar of the Timberline and order a steak, its $17 vs the list price of $27.

My favorite happy hour is at the Dogwood Cabin, with creative cocktails and a few bites to grab at fabulous prices.
(I had the Lavender Martini, which had lavender infused gin, and some other secret ingredients that worked well together... and I had the mac n cheese, which was homemade, fried balls of goodness after skiing knee deep all day) 
My Best Beer was at the Eldo (complete with live bands when ever I walked in) 
My favorite pizza is at the Secret Stash... It was crowded when we walked in, but well worth the wait... and if your in need of liquid lubrication, try the ""Poor boy"" at the bar... a slice, a shot, a beer, for $6!
My favorite late night place is the Lobar... a lounge in the basement of the ""Company Store"" complete with Sushi and a DJ.


As one local put, ""you come to CB for the winter, you'll stay for the summer.""

5599,2009-02-21,Vermont,Burke Mountain,3,"I spent MLK weekend skiing at Burke.  I was apprehensive at first as I grew up in New England and had never even heard of the mountain, but I was won over instantly.  Although it is well north of the some of the bigger and better known Vermont mountains, the low prices and utter lack of crowds even on a holiday weekend with a lot of snow made it a great choice.
 mountain is basically divided into two parts: a beginner's section on the bottom and intermediate/expert terrain on the top.  re is a lodge at the base of both ""halves,"" and you can drive to the mid mountain lodge and avoid the bottom if you desire.  re is only one main lift for each half, but I never waited longer than a minute (literally) to get on a lift all weekend.  
I am a good intermediate skiier, and found the blues to be a nice variety of wide open cruisers and more narrow trails winding through the woods.   expert trails were generally shorter and narrow with large moguls.  re is only one wide open black trail, and that was being used for racing practice much of the weekend (although you could still ski out of the way of the racers).  re were also extensive glade trails.  I saw some tracks but was very surprised I didn't see anyone skiing them.  re was a good selection of trails for beginners and plenty of room for learning and practice.
 conditions were great because they had gotten a good amount of snow the previous week and a half, plus another six inches or so on Sunday.  A lot of snow is necessary as there is not a lot of snow making, especially on the more wooded trails.  For example, a couple of the mogul runs had very thin cover (icy patches and grass/underbrush poking through the snow) even with the fresh snow we got on Sunday and few skiers.
 terrain parks were limited to a few jumps and maybe a single rail.  From what I saw they were used very infrequently.  This could be why there were hardly any snowboarders.
Burke felt like an old school mountain, not a modern .   food in the lodges was your basic fair at average prices.  Most people I saw preferred to bring their food and leave it in either open cubbies or in packs in the locker rooms.   trails felt more natural and winding instead of clear cutting straight down the mountain.   trails were mostly ungroomed, so their character changed over the weekend.  re were very few condos around (although there are rumors of the owners trying to create a destination ), and the towns of Burke and nearby Lyndonville had a handful of bars and restaurants.  I heard one of the lodges had a lot of people hanging out with a band on Sunday night, but was not around to find out.  If so, it was one of the very few places for nightlife.
For a classic skiing experience, Burke is very hard to beat.  You can ski all day on empty trails and get a good microbrew at night before collapsing from exhaustion, and then do it again the next day.  I think it would cater more to intermediate skiiers as there isn't a lot for experts other than glades.   area still has that rustic feel; as my dad put it, ""there was no fashion show.""  I will definitely be back next year.",jfoldno7
5600,2009-02-21,Vermont,Okemo Mountain,5,"	As primarily a Pocono skier, I relish my one or two opportunities a year to travel to the Green Mountain state and run my snowboard through natural, fresh powder.  This year, my 8 man (err… 6 man and 2 woman) travel team headed to Okemo for a four day weekend.  With a pretty even mix of skiers and snowboarders (5 and 3, respectively) as well as beginners, intermediates, and experts (2, 2, and 4 respectively), we all left the mountain after nearly 15 hours of skiing and riding with the same feelings – Okemo was quite possibly the most well maintained, exciting mountains we’ve ever traveled to!

	Okemo is only half as large as nearby Killington, but at times it is tough to realize that.  In two days, I can count on one hand the number of trails I rode twice, and that was only because I loved the terrain!   long, winding set of beginner/intermediate trails that lead from the top of Glades Peak to the Jackson Gore lodge (the top left to bottom right of the trail map) covers a surprising 4 miles!   mountain prides itself on grooming and it shows, but we were able to find some glades, moguls, and simply natural trails, including a fun intermediate run with fun patches of powder called “Off  Rim”.  Groomed, intermediate and (low) expert crusiers are the trails that made Okemo famous and this was obvious.  y are the most numerous and most crowded on the mountain.

	Okemo is an excellent mountain for beginners (there are nice beginner runs from the peak, unlike Killington’s partially uphill trails) and intermediates to sharpen their skills.  Well groomed intermediate crusiers are Okemo’s bread and butter.  With the addition of Jackson Gore and Okemo’s effort to cut more trails through this steep area, experts and mogul lovers can find challenging trails as well.  As clichéd as it sounds, Okemo certainly has something for everyone.

 Good:

	 South Face area of the mountain isn’t easily accessible from the main lifts and doesn’t have its own lodge area, which means that it stays less crowded than the main mountain, especially on weekdays.   high speed lift there gets you to the top in less than five minutes and the 10 trails in the area are over a mile long and fun, especially for out of state tourists who are looking to run all the trails on the mountain – greens, blues, and blacks.

	My group stuck to the wide, groomed crusiers for most of the day, on which the snow conditions were wonderful.  In the week leading up to our trip, Vermont received no significant snow, but the snow guns and grooming machines kept the terrain in great shape.  Although the mountain began to ice up after a windy, crowded Saturday, I would have been hard pressed to find any more than a few, scattered icy locations during the majority of our trip.

	Plenty of lifts for the number of trails!  Only during Saturday afternoon was I forced to wait more than a minute for a lift.   Jackson Gore quad and main, Northstar quad had lines that reached 8 10 minutes, but there were still parts of the mountain that were relatively empty  Glades peak and the aforementioned South Face.

	Ski Defiance.  Check out the views.  Enough said.

 Bad and  Ugly:

	Food quality in the “main” restaurants (read: food courts) was average at best, while the prices were exorbitant.  I spent about $32 on 2 lunches and my comrades who were against filling up their Gatorade bottles at the (hard to find) water fountain were spending near to $25 per day on food and drinks.  Come on, Okemo!  You’ve already charged us $140 for a lift ticket, PLEASE don’t rob another $15 for a burger, fries, and a coke!  (My favorite food was the clam chowder at the Jackson Gore base, but the lodge was so crowded on Saturday at 1 pm that I at half of it standing.)

	Big Bang.  Pay attention to the warning on Okemo’s website that calls this trail the most difficult non gladed trail on the mountain.  It’s the steepest trail on Jackson Gore, which is the steepest area of the  and you’re afforded one of two choices: moguls the size of a small SUV or an “escape route”, a sheet of solid ice to the right.  (Escape through the trees to Tuckered Out.)

 Best Trails:

BEGINNER:  Dream Weaver.  (South Face)  A long, winding (possibly intermediate) cruiser evoked a scream of, “This is the best green I’ve ever skied!” from a member of my party.  I agree.  A few moderately steep pitches give this trail an intermediate feel.  It’s WAY off the beaten path, so getting here early in the day, as I did, will yield you powder and a fun, fast run down the South Face.

BEGINNER:  Coleman Brook / Sidewinder / Rising Star.  This is the most gradual run down the Solitude area of the mountain, and allows you a quick jaunt through Solitude Village under and over the criss crossing roads.

INTERMEDIATE:  Off  Rim.  This was a natural trail when I visited and felt awesome to be kicking up heaps of powder at 9:00 in the morning!  If the trail is groomed, it is the intermediate equivalent of Dream Weaver, mentioned above.

TERRAIN:  Timberline.   Superpark on Nor’easter can be daunting, even to those who ride parks regularly.  Find the hidden Timberline trail, which contains Okemo’s well maintained progression park.  Moderate sized rails and jumps are perfect for the more timid riders.

EXPERT:  Stump Jumper.  This is the third trail I’ve mentioned on the South Face.  Stump Jumper was the expert equivalent of Dream Weaver and Off  Rim, a decently wide, impeccably groomed crusier that runs the entire 1000+ foot South Face vertical.  It’s a blast and my personal favorite diamond at Okemo.

EXPERT:  Upper/Lower Chief.  This felt like the steepest run on the main mountain.  A lot of long, steep pitches at the top leveled out towards the bottom into a wide crusier.  Looking for a great spot for a photo op?  Try under the left about 1/3 of the distance down Upper Chief.

EXPERT:  Quantum Leap.  Two of my comrades chose this straight shot from the top to the bottom of Jackson Gore as their favorite run.  We must have skied/rode it four or five times during our two days on the mountain!  Be prepared for a consistently steep, long run with hundreds of eyes watching you from the lift.",jfoldno7
5601,2009-02-21,Vermont,Magic Mountain Vermont,3,"Skiers   AVOID this place!!
After reading the reviews of Magic Mountain I decided to take time out out of my busy schedule to pay this place a visit. I must say I am very disappointed with the entire experience. I found that it's a bunny hill compared to the real Vermont ski s like Sugarbush, Stowe and Killington.  Most trails were groomed to look like your home w w carpet and there was nothing steep to speak of.   ""glades"" were a joke and with only two lifts the lines were terrible.  Even the base area lodge was crappy and the staff was rude!   only reason I can think of going to this place is if you live next door and don't have a car, or if you are a beginner with kids to take advantage of their ski school.  I'd rather sit home and watch Oprah than go back to this place.

5605,2009-02-21,New York,Whiteface Mountain,5,"     re is a saying that when Whiteface is good, it's very good. When it's bad,  it is very bad. Fortunately, contrary to a previous reviewer, the skiing at Whiteface is excellent MOST of the time. As any ski  will attest,  you are at the mercy of mother nature. Whiteface Mountain is no exception.

     I have skied at whiteface for over 45 years. It is my favorite mountain. It has challenging terrain, easy groomers, a lot of variety and the biggest vertical drop in the east. Because of it's location next to Lake Champlain, it does get it's fair share of snow but at the same time it is susceptible to some strong winds. Fortunately, this only happens a few times a year but when it does, be prepared for extreme conditions. Trail conditions can change by the hour. Know your ability and experience.  

      Lookout Mountain Chair adds new terrain to Whiteface this year. So far, 2 new trails are open including the 2.5 mile intermediate ""Wilmington Trail"" and a short but steep trail called ""Lookout Below"".

       Kid's Kampus is a wonderful area for kids and beginner skiers. I has it's own lodge and is away from, but connected to the main ski area. main ski lodge at the base of the Gondola, is the main jumping off  point for the entire mountain. re is a large cafeteria, coffee shop, rental shop, ski school, lift tickets, ski patrol and the Cloudsplitter Lounge.re is plenty of room to store your ski bags for the day and does have a check in storage area for your ski bag if you prefer. 

     Not only is the skiing excellent at Whiteface  Mountain but its neighbor, the Village of Lake Placid, is the perfect setting to spend your winter vacation. Home of the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics, this town has it all. You can catch a hockey game, watch a figure skating event, maybe go to the movies, or a concert, shop until t you drop or just have have a great dinner . Lake Placid is vibrant little town that has a lot to like even if you don't ski.

5608,2009-02-22,New York,Belleayre,4,"Belleayre is a state park.  It's a fun place to hang out without pressure to be seen.  It's not a """" so don't expect to find people parading around looking for action and parties.  Go into the lodge, drop your boot bag in a bin, change your clothes in the main room, take your time, relax.  Buy lunch, or bring your own.   point is skiing at your own pace.  It's probably not overly challenging, but I'm always able to find something that makes me work at technique.   place really does feel as comfortable as a hike in the woods with a good friend.  I tend to ski there mid week, when there is no line at the lifts, but even on weekends, they handle the crowds just fine.",apken
5614,2009-02-22,Colorado,Aspen Snowmass,3,"     This was the first year I have ever ridden snowmass. I was impressed and definatly plan on returning. Everyone I traveled with had a great time, and although we had diffrent abilities, we all found a fun challenge. re was no fresh snow the day we went but it was still a lot of fun, warm and sunny.  We did have to stop breifly to lend a hand to an injured skier, but I was quite impressed with the response of the ski patrol. It made me corney as it may sound ""feel safer"". I travel to vail evry year and definatly plan on making the drive to check aspen out each year for a few days!! thanks and see you all on the mountain.",Ian England
5615,2009-02-22,Colorado,Vail,3,"re are some mountains that if you go and spend a week there by day four you have seen just about everything there is to see and do and are just going back to whatever trails you previously enjoyed.  Vail is not one of those mountains.  Spread out with a solid selection of terrain, Vail has plenty to offer.   only major downside is that due to its popularity the mountain can fill up.  

 lifts at Vail are almost universally outstanding but there are still lift lines, which just goes to show you the volume of visitors the  regularly receives.  I recommend making your way on to the backside and going toward Blue Sky.   lines tend to be shorter and the terrain is outstanding.  

Vail is worth the trip and has a little something for everyone.  You can easily spend a week here and not come close to seeing it all.  ",Ian England

5619,2009-02-22,Michigan,Nubs Nob,5,"10:00am Sunday morning, the last Sunday of winter, and the skiing is fantastic at Nubs Nob. Perfectly groomed conditions, 20 degrees and not a cloud in the sky. 1:30 Sunday afternoon and the skiing is wonderful. Hardly a lift line anywhere. Just ski down and sit down on the chair. Still sking untracked corduroy on the edge of the runs. Lots of snow everywhere and only a few icy spots.  conditions are still in mid winter form, and should stay good if it doesn't rain or get warm.  snow softened in the afternoon, but the chair seats warmed in the afternoon sun and it was amazing.  first time I ever thought I was riding a lift with heated seats. Big party planned for this coming weekend, so the lift lines may be longer. ",J

Snow has intermediate trails for all  my favorites are Ridge, Snowdance and the entire Sunbrook area Less crowds on this side of mountain and views are phenominal  like a whole different world over here.   one drawback is crowds on weekends  but the high speed quad seems to develop longest lines  better alternative on weekends is Summit Triple  no lines but much longer ride.",skiergirl27 
5631,2009-02-04,Pennsylvania,Shawnee Mountain,3,My son and I went to Shawnee on 3/12/08 and we wanted to learn how to snowboard.  Last time I was on any mountain was over 20years ago and I have to say I was a bit scared.  We were able to get some discount coupons and ended up paying 59.00 per person for a complete snowboarding beginner package which included rentals/lessons and lift ticket.  From the rentals to the lesson the Shawnee staff was excellent.  Jesse our instructor was the best   he knew we had never done this before and helped us without making me feel like I was crazy in attempting this.  re was about 10 people total on the learning slope which was great as I was not scared to fall and get hurt by someone coming down the slope.  We had snacks at the lodge and it wasn't that bad considering I had heard that food at the mountain can be expensive.  My son had a ball and picked up snowboarding well.  Kudos to Jesse and all the staff we will be back next year during the off peak season to do it again!,resa 1
5636,2009-02-23,New Hampshire,Ragged Mountain,4,"Our family had a great day at Ragged this weekend.  Conditions were about perfect.   best thing about this mountain is that you park in the parking lot, and walk up to the mountain.  No shuttles or buses or trains are needed to get you there!  Rates were affordable  even better on weekdays.  Even on a beautiful Saturday morning, we got our kids rental equipment and got ourselves on the mountain within about 15 minutes.  All morning, the trails on the smaller peak were nearly deserted.   green trail from the top of the Spear Mountian lift was long and wide.  Sections of it are a bit steep for a true beginner, so beware if you are just learning.  But if you are a skiier who prefers greens and easy blues, it was perfect.  re were two shorter green trails for beginners. My husband skiied some steep black diamonds and said they were good.   long green trail on the taller peak was ungroomed and marked expert only for some reason, but there were other easy options for getting down from there too.  It did get crowded for a bit after lunch (as you would expect!)  but overall, lift lines moved quickly, and the trails were usually not overcrowded.  I recommend this mountian famlies of all abilities.",bostowyo
5643,2009-02-23,Wisconsin,Christie Mountain,5,Christie Mountain was definately fun.  It was a small hill but made up for it in the awesome terrain park.  I'd say this is in the top 3 terrain parks in WI.  It was groomed great and oftenshowing that they care.

Kettle Bowl, Navarijno Slopes, and Camp Ten are all Wisconsin Mountains that are all more challenging and have steeper slopes than Tyrol Basin but for some reason, are not included on this website.

Wish these small places would take a look at how Grand Geneva Grooms...  Adding an ""S"" turn to any hill is easy and turns a basic Green run into something that doesn't get boring. 

If Villa Olivia lowered its weekly pricing and opened earlier during 1pm would be nice, I would go every week. Instead I take an hour drive to Grand Geneva spend 1/2 the amount for a FULL day.",J

Alpen bar is good, people are friendly all over. Actually fairly cheap eats/drinks compared with most places.  Some good steep runs and some nice longer blues on the far side of the Mt.  greens are pretty flat and this would be a good place for every skill level.  Would go back again, probably the best snow I've been on in the midwest.  Also, lots of snowmobilers around, whom you will see mixed into the night life.",Mike134
5653,2009-02-23,Minnesota,Spirit Mountain,4,"This past Sunday kicked off four straight days of heartland skiing for me, starting at my home hill, Spirit Mountain.  It was the first time I had skied Spirit since our giant warm up/rain the past few weeks, so I was less than confident on the conditions of the slopes.  Turns out, I was surprised at how good of shape they were in.

 past two weeks have erased the awesome season that we've had up until then.  With a record setting December for snowfall, plus great temps to keep the snow soft, we were starting to get spoiled in the Midwest.  n two weeks ago, reality caught up with us, and warmed up the temperatures to 40 degrees and dumped rain on us.  Most of our snowfall in the area disappeared, replaced with brown grass, and the slopes at Spirit turned into boiler plate ice.  But thanks in part to the great grooming at Spirit, not all was lost.

You can't ski the trees or ""off piste"" really at Spirit any more because anywhere that isn't groomed doesn't have enough coverage.  But the base on the slopes is still plenty deep, and the groomers have been taking advantage of that fact.  Combined with .5"" and 1"" off and on lake effect snow, they've managed to keep the runs in great shape.  However, you are now hearing the ""ssssssscrape"" of skis and boards on the snow again  something that had been absent most of the winter at Spirit because of the awesome snow.

So if you head to Spirit Mountain, you'll only see runs that are in the same shape as they normally are in: icy, just like the rest of the Midwest.  What loose snow there is has the consistency of powdered sugar, and isn't deep enough to keep your edges from that familiar ""ssssssscrape"" noise.

 conditions of the slopes are Spirit Mountain's fault, but the lift situation is.  Spirit is still having trouble with their main lift that runs the length of their big run, Four Pipe.  Although they are still using it, it frequently stops and is stuck for minutes at a time.  Be cautious if you ski Spirit, and try to avoid this chair.  Spirit Mountain is running the little green chair on Four Pipe as well as the double that runs next to the chalet (at least on weekends).

Other than that, Spirit is still the destination ski spot it was shaping up to be...even with the warm up.  Truth be told, with the exception of Lutsen, Spirit is probably in the best shape of all the Minnesota ski s (Twin Cities s are in a sad state of affairs, reference my Welch Village review from this week).",Richard Min
5654,2009-02-23,Michigan,Nubs Nob,5," last stop for the weekend and it was a great way to finish.

5661,2009-02-24,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"Our family (4 teens and myself   no wife) went there in early Feb 2009. We have a timeshare there   Grand Timber   so we were right on the mountain, which is always a great benefit   ski on/off. Breckenridge has terrain for all abilities including several terrain parks. It has plenty of groomed cruisers, bowls, mogul fields. Breck has four major peaks (Peaks 7 8 9 10) and is spread out so you will not get bored easily. I personally like bowl skiing and the steeper slopes which automatically keeps the crowd down. and the kids love the terrain park so we split our time to get plenty of both. Of the six days in CO this year, we spent 4 at Breckenridge (day trips to Vail and Keystone). It didn't snow while we were there :( but there was plenty of sun and good times for all. Eating out in Breckenridge was very good as well   I would recommend the Hearthstone and Cafe Alpine. Final two points   the water tastes great (probably because we are from the East) and the high altitude (over 12,000 ft) can be a problem so I made sure I had HA medication.

5667,2009-02-24,Wisconsin,Whitecap Mountain,5,"re are alot of runs, but they are short for the area.   snow was horrible compared to the s just across in Michigan.   do the worst job of grooming I have ever seen at any ski hill, which makes the boarding/skiing crap. Most runs were not groomed at all and consisted of mostly ice balls. Lots of little jumps and bumps for boarders, however the terrain park is pretty weak. Some advanced terrain runs, but again, they are short.  If you are this close, just get your moneys worth and go to Big Powderhorn or Indianhead. y are both MUCH better taken care of and are better in every way.  and unless you want a cheeseburger or chicken strips and a can of pop, pack a lunch, cause that's all they have.",J
5669,2009-02-24,Michigan,Big Powderhorn Mountain,5,"Skied this past weekend at Powderhorn and hit the jackpot Sunday morning.  12"" of new fluffy powder......they left the steeper slopes alone and groomed the greens so everyone had a great time.  I watched some kids on double barrel and it looked they had as much fun falling in the snow as skiing it.  No crowds all weekend, and the house near the hill I rented had an outdoor hot tub so it was a very nice time.   6 1/2 hour drive from Chicago is worth the trip.",Jim Dana
5673,2009-02-24,Minnesota,Spirit Mountain,3,"I skied Spirit again on Saturday and was once again happy about how well the snow is holding up.  It was a little chilly, but since the wind wasn't bad, it was very tolerable (the wind is what makes the weather at Spirit so horrible at times).   snow is still holding up well.  It gets a little icy after the sun dips down around 4pm, but from noon to 3:30 or so is the best time to be on the snow.

 quad chair next to Four Pipe seems to be running without incident (at least Saturday it was).  Spirit's doing a great job managing their lift lines and making sure that they fill up every chair so people don't have to wait forever.  So kudos to them for that.  Also, they were running every single chair on Saturday to help keep the lines down.

Skied for about 5 hours, and had a few beers at the Moosehead afterword.  Overall a good day on the snow, and no real surprises (like broken lifts!)",Richard Min

I would say it is a mid size mountain. It was only crowded on the slopes around the bottom of the mountain (pretty standard for all s).   powder was great.  We got snow everyday (4 days in a row) and a couple of the days we were making fresh tracks on the slopes in the mid afternoon   awesome.  Before we got there we heard that the workers were always happy and in a good mood, this is absolutley true.  I went with 6 other people and we had a great time.  re wasn't a whole lot to do at night time around the , but they do have restaurants, bars, shops, etc. for entertainment and dining.  So it is a place that would be fun for you and your buddies, or you and the family.   mountain itslef was good for all types of skiers, beginner   expert.  You can make your ski runs as hard or as easy as you want to.  Plenty of ski runs and terrian to chose from.  I definetly recommend Copper as a place you have to ski at least once.  ",RICK STEPHENS
5675,2009-02-24,Wisconsin,Devils Head,5,"This is not my first time to Devils Head Resort, but it is the first time I have gone during the week.  

You can avoid the crowds during the week for sure, but if you want to get a meal after the runs close (10pm) you are going to need quarters.  same time the runs close, so does the kitchen   MISTAKE!!!  at least have a limited menu until 10:30pm or room service, SOMTHING.  No fun driving an hour just to get the closest burger.

Devils Head is still my favorite hill close to home (Chicago).   runs are kept in great condition and the atmosphere is very nice.  Meet a lot of great people on the slopes.  Only one downside...   Staff.  A majority of the staff seems to be older, and not as friendly as other s (Chestnut has the friendliest staff).  We had a few run ins with rude staff...   nicest staff were all young adults.

 last staff encounter we had at Devils Head before leaving was at Equipment Returns.   ""RUDE   Older"" guy there says ""You better find that yellow paper or you have a problem"".  He must be joking right...  We tell him, ""How about the photo ID you photo copied?"".  ""NOPE, you need that slip of paper"".  So we gave him our Photo ID, he finally took the time to look it up and we were out of there. Not the best taste left in our mouths, but the people dont make or break the mountain for us.  It's all about the slopes!

My skiing partner (and son) had been waiting for Goat to open for business, but our first stop was Liftline.  Liftline had become our favorite trail and the place to sharpen your skills become moving up the list.  By the end of the day, my partner had covered the all the front four and all other black  available.  I could only say ... wow.  FYI .. Goat is not groomed and has only natural snow.  Goats provides all types of obstacles includes boulders, level drops, trees, exposed ice and rocks and absolutely huge moguls over a narrow passage.  Many people say they've mastered Goat; the reality is only a very few even try and most are claimed by the run.  Even the seasoned veteran's are somewhere between fear and total skiing thrill.

It really is a just a hill, small area, short runs.  Not a big deal, this is the midwest after all.  We needed rentals for the children and lift tickets for all of us.   staff was not very nice and unprofessional in appearance.  We never were greeted with a nice hello, or good morning.  Once on the hill, we were again disappointed by the terrain.  After our day of skiing, we made our way to the base lodge to check in.  Very nice lobby area and grill/bar, but the room was outdated and had a bad smell.  That night we got online to find a different place to ski the next day.  Luckily there was another  near by.

We started by heading over to North Peak and skiing a few of the black runs off that lift, which felt very samey, and not inspiring.  We then walked up and skied in the South Bowl, which was excellent, and then took the snowcat up and skiied in the North Bowl, which was also very good.  I thought it was wrong that the snowcat was extra to the lift ticket, but I suppose they had to find some way to manage demand.

Even once I had all the basics down and started broadening my horizons, there were plenty of runs to challenge my growing abilities. A number of the runs are lengthy providing a lot of opportunity to hone your skills on the way down without having to stop, trek back up, and do it again.

This is the best place to really just fly down a mountain and feel like you went somewhere. People are friendly and the  is just off the highway. Though I can't vouch for the resent additions of a water park, several condos and so on.  last time I was there the only overnight lodging available was a family owned motel and a Super 8.",treesker

Mt snow has one of the biggest terrain parks ive ever seen and even if your not competing in thedew tour it is a great mt.n. y have the main face which has a little above par trails and they are pretty long and only 1 diamond.  only bad thing is there is this one trail that is sooooooooooo crowded you cant walk down it. It is like a minefield of people who stink and the elders but it is nice to cruze in the morning. y have carinthia which is a whole side of the mt.n dedicated to terrain parks(20 trails est)
y have big ones(dew tour ) and small ones for the soon to be pros.Next they have a backside which is always full of powder and nobody. the trails are squares and a few have mogouls. Lastly there is north side. It is basicially a cliff.  trails are hard (there is one square 2 diamonds and 7 are doubles.)  lodges are nice they have that NY adirondeck (sorry had to write this in a hurry) feeling with the huge mt.n. It is never crowded and they alway have a helpful lesson for everyone. Hope this helped and have fun out there. Cya on the mt.n guys(and girls)",Ian

5741,2009-03-02,Minnesota,Spirit Mountain,5,"It seems like Spirit Mountain's conditions are changing by the day.  Yesterday I skied for race league, then took a few turns afterword to just have some fun and unwind.  Maybe it was because the sun had been down for an hour or so, but the snow was really hard and icy.  However, when the groomer went by on one of the other trails, the snow was soft and the corduroy was surprisingly deep.  I tracked up the groomer's little path to feel that soft, bottomless edge you can only get while skiing good groomers.

 Moosehead was busy because of race league.  Everyone was having fun, and for once, the place seemed like a good ski  bar.  Pitchers of Premium were being poured (at a relatively decent price), and some decent buffalo strips were being consumed (also at a decent price).  Like the snow conditions, the Moosehead had drastically changed...from a weary, empty bar to bustling  bar.  Too bad they had to close it down at 10pm!

Spirit Mountain still has good snow, it's just that it's getting blown and pushed around.  When the groomers can work their magic, you can get cord that rivals the quality of out West.  But when the wind is blowing, or the weekend hordes swarm Spirit, the good snow will be blown or scraped away.  So get their early!",Richard Min
5744,2009-03-02,Pennsylvania,Camelback Mountain,4,"I grew up skiing at Mont Tremblant and skied mostly out West as an adult. i was reluctant to ski east but have kids and we need week end entertainment. I really think for what it is, Camelback is great. Some tips:

* deals. Under 18 get a junior ticket (not just those under 13). Rent from ski barn and u get a passbook with a ""buy 1 adult get 2 kids free"" .  camelcard requires 3 trips to payout   worth it
* ski the middle lifts for the shortest lines   and the main lift early and late
* bring your own lunch   you can leave a knapsack and eat yout lunch pretty much in any lodge
* on week ends if you are not renting, take the left hand turn where the tubing is and park up by the first small lodge (on the left well before  before the main lodge) you can see the two beginning lifts from there. much faster and easier. 
* if renting skis, rent for $20 at one of several places on your left as you drive in about 1/2 mile before the hill   cheaper and faster and you can then use the better parking",soakandski

5759,2009-02-10,Vermont,Mt. Snow,5,"whether your skiing for your first time, competing in the dew tour, a resident of west dover, or on a family ski vacation, mount snow delivers everything you'd expect in a ski .

 mountain is phenominal, over 100 trails and about 98% snowmaking. if it is your first trip to vermont you will find it impossible to stay on a trail. the mountain is huge, spanning four faces.

mainface is where you can get started  it has wide trails, and a select few difficult ones, it has the boonies  glades on the far, far right side, i wouldn't reccomend trying them. the trails here are perfect for cruising and getting situated, you could spend your whole day here.

northface has the majority of the difficult slopes at mount snow. it has three different glades, the trials is hailed by some as the greatest glades run on the mountain, it is worth checking out. the northface also has a few easier diamonds, and a couple difficult ones, such as ripcord and jaws. by no means should you go here if this is your first week skiing, but all the runs are exhilirating, and the lifts and view are GREAT.

Carinthia  the ""now famous"" park side of the mountain. remember, mount snow is owned by peak s  and what a smart move making this into an all park face was. this is not your family friendly face. it is for kids looking to jib, spin, and show off. it is great fun and has gotten the mountain on national TV for the winter dew tour. when i was at the mountain, carinthia was yet to be converted

sunbrook  see for yourself. a very fun and unique face



all in all, the mountain is covered with plenty of glades and steep runs. of course the parks on carinthia are amazing.

this mountain's glades, however, do not compare to those of jay peak and smuggs, which is unfortunate.

the lodge is great, very spacious, and tony's pizza is really good. those waffles at the summit are godly, you cannot pass them up.

all the local condos and hotels are great, i stayed at the andiron  there WAS NOT wi fi in the rooms we were in, too far from the source i suppose.

in conclusion, mount snow is a great mountain for anyone looking for a great vacation and a great time. park rats look no further, powder slayers and rope duckers look a little bit further north ;)

5767,2009-03-04,Colorado,Silverton Mountain,3,"I skied Silverton last March (I agree with another reviewer that March April are the best months to go), and had a great time.  Being an expert skier, I've done my fair share of extreme skiing, especially in various spots in France, Telluride, and perhaps the best mountain ever, Jackson Hole.  I must say that, though the skiing was extreme and is only for those in the top 2 3% ski level, it was a bit overrated overall.  I think the guides/staff there knows this, thus they try to mess with you mentally with the ""you might die today"" wavers, which are lame.  Same goes for the beacon and other av. equipment they require.  You could die skiing Buttermilk or some east coast mountain, but you won't see such silly wavers from them.  As for the guides, they are hit or miss.  Some are cool dudes, others aren't.

Overall, if double blacks are boring to you, and you need a little adrenaline kick, then Silverton is for you.   uniqueness of Silverton itself is awesome as well (no frills, one lift, etc.)  However, the hiking (especially back to the lift after a run) gets old really quick.  Don't expect to do more than 5 6 runs a day.  Finally, as great as Silverton is, it still takes a backseat to Jackson Hole.  Several of the runs at J Hole (such as the famed Corbet's Couloir) trump anything Silverton can throw at you, and they don't require unnecessary beacons or a signed death certificate either.  In fact, I'd recommend skiing Silverton to prepare for skiing at Jackson Hole.  But, overall its a great time and not as intimidating as they'd have you believe.",isaac reule
5768,2009-03-04,Minnesota,Spirit Mountain,4,"I skied Spirit this past Thursday because it was snowing like crazy in Duluth.  Unfortunately, the wind was also whipping as well.  I got on the hill at about 5pm and found that on north east facing runs, the snow was blown around terribly bad.  It was piled every three feet, about 5 inches deep, but then would give away three feet more to bare ice.  Additionally, the snow was hitting me in the face so hard, it felt like buckshot.  So I opted to try something else.

I skied Gandy Dancer and Cinder Snapper and couldn't believe was a little more north west facing slope offered: ankle deep snow without the ridging caused by the wind.  I lapped Gandy and Cinder Snapper and found the snow along the trees to be the absolute best (but careful enough not to dip in too far and get hit by the death cookies underneath!).  It was almost as good as my first Midwest powder day back in December, but the snow just wasn't as deep...here I was skiing anke deep, when that faithful day back in December it was at least shin deep.

I wasn't complaining.  All the runs that were facing a bit out of the north east blowing wind were in great shape...snow was spread across the runs perfectly making for some great, scrape free powdery turns.  We skied 'till close, only stopping to warm up for a few minutes at a time.

re was no one at the  that night...maybe it was because it was Thursday, or maybe they felt the wind was too terrible.  As it turns out, those who toil get to reap the benefits.   snow was deep for Spirit Mountain, and the turns were soft and powdery...something you don't get to say in the Midwest very much.

I'm heading back to Spirit tonight, so I'll update soon and let you know what the conditions are like now that the groomers have had their way.  Knowing how great the grooming is at Spirit nowadays, I'm thinking it's going to be some phenomenal soft corduroy.  Stay tuned!",Richard Min

Obviously I was hoping to ski some powder, but even though we didn't get one of those serious dumps I loved every minute.  I love skiing the trees, and with just a little effort I was able to find little plenty of cool little shots to enjoy.  I'm also a mogul fanatic, and was able to get plenty of bumps while skiing of the never crowded Wildcat lift. On a clear bluebird day, I'm not sure there's a ski area that is more picturesque, and on my last day I took a few more runs then my legs wanted just so I could soak in the atmosphere from the lift.   But probably the best part about Alta is the clientele it attracts   no one comes here to be pampered in five star luxury, they come here to ski.  I stayed at the Alta Peruvian, and made friends from the moment I arrived.  If you're a die hard skier, visiting this classic mountain is absolutely mandatory!",dubisaweapon

If you are planning on a spring break trip, you should change plans or be prepared for disappointment.  Any crusty ice that would have been ridable with some warmer temps got blown off the mountain yesterday during 40mph winds....which means the front side is closed down and you get to take the dust bus ride to the back side....walk through a muddy parking lot....and enjoy crappy conditions on the backside.

5802,2009-03-09,Michigan,Timber Ridge,2,"I've been snowboarding for 6 years now, I have ridden all of the s in SW Michigan, and Timber Ridge is by far the best. re is a good variety of terrain just around the , unlike bittersweet where everything is flat. 

 Timber Park features many challenging features including but not limited to up, flat, down, flat, up rails, a battleship rail and box, a cannon rail, and log ride. Also there is 6 kickers ranging from 25ft to 55ft, and more.  Pumpkin park is the perfect place to warm up for the day with a small 10ft tabletop, a butter box, a flat wide rail, a down wide rail, and a wide c rail. Both parks feature rope tows, which is great for sessioning one feature, and also to keep all newbs out. Timber Ridge also does not alow rentals in the terrain parks which also helps with crowd control. Both parks are maticulously maintained, and enough of the riders take pride in their s that if a feature is getting dug out, that they will repair it, including myself.

Timber Ridge is a very family oriented place, it is a great place for families to take a weekend to visit. Unlike bittersweet and Swiss Valley, you won't hear much swearing at all. As far as night life goes, timber offers snowboarding and skiing well into the night, only negative thing about this is that the slopes tend to get icy at this point.

All in all, if you enjoy any winter downhill sport, Timber Ridge is the place to be. ",Ryan Pringnitz

Arriving at Mammoth, it was an absolute blast staying on the mountain.  kiddie park was great for me to start learning jumps and boxes.   terrain was all over the place from huge, steep runs to easy greens to help my wife learn to link turns.  

It was easily one of the best trips always.  A few instances of the LA attitude you heard about, but the place is so big and the staff so cool is easy just to cruise the mountain and enjoy the ride.

My 4 yr old daughter had just taken an all day lesson at another mountain, but did not ski well at all   she just felt comfortable.   bunny hill with its slow and short double lift was a perfect place for my beginner wife to help teach my daughter to begin to ski.   people were nice, the mountain staff were friendly and helpful.   next day we purchased a private 1 hour lesson for my 4 year old and in 30 minutes she had mastered the bunny hill and was beginning to ski by herself on the the short green.   instruction was so good and she was so comfortable that a few weeks later we went to Beear Creek where she was able to ski herself on all of the greens there and a week after that could ski all the blues at Shawnee.  Elk is the perfect place to get great instruction.

As for me and the boys, the mountain was so big, and the boys still to inexperienced to ski anything but the long green from the top  and a few of the shorter blues.  however, Elk has two intermediate length greens fed by an intermediate length lift that enabled my wife and snowboarding 10 year old to feel comfortable developing skills without having to risk the top of the mountain.  My 7 year old skier and i had a blast skiing the long green and some short blues as we honed our skills, as this is only our second real season skiing.

 great thing about Elk, besides its great trails and really good snow (it snowed 8 inches the day we arrived) is that the people are all serious skiers.  Even the riders understand skiing etiquette and are respectful of the other skiers and riders.  Even the beginners understand where to stop and how to merge.

Get there early, though, because the front side lifts crowd up quickly, and you want to get to the bowls as soon as possible. Follow the sunshine, and don't forget to go over to Blue Sky Basin.

5863,2009-03-16,Wyoming,Snow King,4,it is very close to the hotels and condos and the snow is decent its also close enough to walk to almost anywhere in jackson and so you can walk just about everywhere and if you are willing to drive a little way or ride a bus for half an hour you can get to jackson hole if you are looking to branch out great place very fun,beefcake1313
5864,2009-03-16,Wyoming,Snow King,4,andes is a great  for families and offers great runs for any ability. Expert terrain is lacking but that’s expected for a Midwest . Black runs are great for carving and can get good air off of natural lips on Worm Gear.,beefcake1313
5865,2009-03-16,Utah,Brian Head,5,"I went to Brian this past January and loved it.  I've skied all over the West coast, but stopped at Brian Head because I was in Southern Utah.  If you're looking for a big mountain  experience, you should probably skip Brian Head.  That being said, if you want a hassle free day of trees and powder and fun, it's worth a visit if the snow is there.  y get less snow than the Northern Utah mountains, but when the storm paths dip south you get very similar powder.  Not much to do besides ski/ride, but for me that's fine   I prefer a fireplace in my condo/cabin versus a crowded bar with bad ski lodge rock on the p.a.!
Highly recommended for families and beginners.  Also highly recommended for skiers/riders who like to explore as there are lots of hidden treats around the mountain (hint   Devo's Pitch has some fun backcountry when the gates are open!)",Bmorabito
5866,2009-03-16,New York,Mt. Peter,3,"First, im not going to say that it is small but great for the location. It is basicially like a giant hill with trees. It really doesnt have destinct trails but there are trails for everyone. y have nice flat circles up to diamonds with mogouls. It is very family friendly and have a nice lodge. It is right next to Tuxedo ridge and it is way better. Peter always has better conditions form december all the way to late march. Mt peter has very cheap prices but some of its lifts could use a little work. Whats nice is if you buy a season pass you get the lift their, discounted food, and discounts at belleayre too. Basically it is one of the better of the 4(holiday, peter,tuxedo ridge, west point) local mt.ns(local as in orange county). If you live in this area go to peter. y have better conditions and prices.

So even though the lifts aren't the most modern, there is no line to wait.  overall time is therefore the same as some big  with modern lifts and huge lines. re are hidden runs and great tree skiing. y always seem to have a deep base and powder stashes.  liftees especially the bunny hill are very friendly which makes it great for kids. For those expecting a social lodge atmosphere, this is not your place. This place is for an all day affair with the mountain not its people. and snowboarders beware, the backside cat track has some uphill, so either drop into the trees as soon as you can or keep your speed up to explore what's around the corner.

My daughter was in the all day kids club ski school.  Instructors were professional and friendly, and she had two great days on the mountain and improved greatly.  re is a good variety of terrain, although true experts won't be terribly challenged.  Some lifts are slow, but the express quad is fast and provides access to nearly the entire mountain.  For a holiday weekend with exceptionally beautiful weather, lift lines were short to non existent.

I have since outgrown everything at the . This year is the straw that broke the camel's back. y increases the ticket price and have offered no changes except for the rise in the price of food.   has started offering tubing now which is apparently the new hot thing for s. y acquired new property next to  and added a new tubing hill.  old hill that was used previously was turned into a beginner hill which isn't surfaced by a decent lift or tow rope. Another thing is there added progression terrain park.  tiny run is always overcrowded by people walking up the hill because the area is once again not serviced by a proper lift. If Brandeywine doesn't take the money they have made ripping off people this season and invest in new runs or lifts like other s do then I won't be back next season.,Hunter McPherson

5894,2009-03-16,Idaho,Sun Valley,2,"I grew up skiing Sun Valley nearly every year.  When I took up snowboarding a couple of years ago, we planned a trip to Sun Valley.  I was a little hesitant to hit such a big ""ski mountain"" on a snowboard but after the first day, I was in heaven.  

 week we stayed was right after a huge snowstorm so every run aside from the beginner runs were covered in thigh deep powder making the more difficult runs a lot of fun to test out with fairly new snowboard skills.   runs are really long and there is a lot of opportunity to go off the trails to explore the tree lined sides.  re was really no part of the mountain that was disappointing.   mountain is geared a little more towards skiers with a lot of moguls and the terrain park is not on Baldy, but we did not have any troubles keeping ourselves busy.

 food at the lodges and around town was fantastic.  We found a lot of great places to go hang out afterwards.  One night was Lefty's which is a local dive with great bar food, gotta try their special fries, that was filled to the gills with the less wealthy locals.   next night we went to a bar on main street and enjoyed a more upper crust drinking experience, lots of cozy couches and a warm fireplace to stay warm in front of.  Another night, we went to a Sun Valley Suns Hockey game which was an awesome experience.  Honestly though, we were so wiped out from snowboarding in powder all day that we were in bed by 10 to get ready for the next day.

We did take a day off to go to Soldier Mountain which was about 1.5 hours away.  Soldier was half the price with pretty good runs but very off the beaten path.  Soldier was a nice change of pace from Baldy.  Quiet runs, only locals, and very relaxed.  

I would recommend renting a condo if you are going with a group of people or a family.  A little bit less expensive than the s and most of the condos are close to shuttle stops that will take you in to town and to and from the mountain.  We were able to stay in an exquisite home with four people for about half the price of staying at the lodge.",iwill

Even though the park is not on the same par as Timberline or Meadows it is up and coming and every year it gets a bit better so many KUDOS to the park guys there keepin it real on a budget and with real park guys who actually maintain through out the day and not just at open and close.

Many trails were closed (but not posted so) and the ones that were open were just ice with a dusting of  powder on top.  My son, who is a good skier, sat inside for an hour or so.  I was afraid of getting hurt as they crated off several skiers in the morning.  It's a cute mountain with very nice views and I suppose it has potential.   lodges are nice and roomy (which is rare) and they have a pub with a nice menu and good beer selection.  We'll go back to Butternut or Mohawk before returning to Catamount.  y could do a much better job.

Lots of terrain, friendly and helpful staff, great tree runs, no lift lines, beautiful views, this place had it all.  only thing is all the blacks and double blacks are ungroomed and jam packed with moguls. This is not so bad when it's powdery, but if there's ice, forget it. I wish there were just a couple nice steep groomers to fly on. Terrain parks need work.

Saturday was crowded and found to have quit a few younger people out of control, but that seems to be normal for any park or place of business.   surrounding area had lots to do, and many establishments such as restaurants, and shops.

If you love getting into deep snow then this  is well worth the visit.

Even if you're not up for the steep and deep you can find plenty of easier trails with acessable powder close by.  only downside to this  was how slow the lifts were, which meant long lift lines on busy days.Food and drinks at the base of the  are very reasonable compared with other s near lake Tahoe , probably due to its location , but I personally love driving through the snowy mountains.

I was snowboarding and noticed quite a few runouts where I had to unstrap my bindings and push my way 'down' the run.  If you want to go for a little hike and can ski the terrain, head up the mountains on the back side to the chutes and steep double black area of Montezuma Bowl  it's well worth it.   snow at those areas was untouched, as many people didn't want to exert that much energy.

Could have been the conditions but the lines were very short on this Friday.  Not sure about the crowd sizes on the weekends.

Resort has a great little downtown type area at the base if you have non skiers in the group they won't have any trouble spending your money during the day.  Ticket prices were a little steep but that seems to be the trend these days.  Save yourself some money and buy your tickets/rentals/lessons on line before you go (there is a 10 20% discount for doing this).

Also, they have night skiing 5 nights a week and plenty of runs open at night with good lighting!  view from the top on a clear day is great as well (overlooks Lake Winnipesauke). So, my question is   why would anyone spend the extra time and money going to "" White's"" when one can go to Gunstock and have just as much fun, on absolutely awesome conditions (right now anyway), and leave with some money left in your pockets (be sure to keep them zipped so you won't loose the money you saved!!)???     :)     Ride on!!!

5992,2009-03-19,Colorado,Purgatory Mountain,3,"I've been here about 6 times over the last 10 yrs. and this one had to be the worst of all.  Slushy conditions and not enough snow.  Weird since all the other times I've been here have been great...sunny days and fresh powder about every morning.  Staying at the slopeside lodge right at the lifts is a must.  Too far to stay in Durango, about a 30 min. drive (or more) if you don't mind that, but I prefer not dealing w/rental car or bus with ski/poles, etc.  Not a real party place, being an old mining town, but great for skiers and Durango has a few nice restaurants.

5996,2009-03-19,California,Heavenly Mountain,3,"I couldn't stop looking at the views from each part of the runs.  Seeing Lake Tahoe surrounded by snowcapped mountains was breath taking, and I was frequently distracted by vistas of the desert.  This area has so much to offer.

Some of the ""runs"" are pretty flat for a while, especially when transitioning from one area to another, but I guess that can't be helped sometimes.

One of the days I was there, the gondola and some of the lifts had to be closed due to high winds.  I could still ski the California side or the Nevada side, but couldn't ski from one to the other.   trams were still available to transport me back and forth if I had chosen that.  Since I was staying at the base of the gondola, it was frusterating, but again, the tram took me between my hotel and the open lifts in a matter of minutes.

I had purchased a pass online more that 2 weeks before I left Florida for my trip and was disappointed that they did not arrive before I had to leave.  It was easy enough to get the pass at the gondola base, but I had to wait in line nearly 45 minutes, a step I could have skipped.

Getting my equipment was fast and easy and the rental shop stored my skis for easy retrieval every morning. I was even able to switch to another pair of boots at a different shop so I didn't have to return to the gondola base when I decided the pair I had wasn't working for me.   second pair was fantastic  even though the sizes were the same.",herbsmen

Lots of flat light, so wear clear or lightly tinted goggles.  food is overpriced and underwhelming, the booze expensive. Plenty of apres ski promotions, though, and with such a big crowd, and lots of young professional people from Boston, a great people watching experience.  ",psuguy43094

Snow was great!  2 of us were beginners and found the ski instructors and personnel to be easy to work with and very helpful.  2 of us were more experienced and they found the trails to be challenging especially on the Mary Jane side.  No lines on Friday.  We stayed at the Iron Horse Resort and found it to be very clean.   ski depot at the Iron Horse was great.  y took their time fitting us for skis and gave us some great advise.  Even though we were ski in/ski out, we took the shuttle the first day.   We were the first to be picked up and the first to be dropped off.   Very convenient and easy.  Great restaurants also.

6019,2009-03-22,Vermont,Burke Mountain,4,"Not sure what some other reviewer(s) are talking about in regard to lack of beginner terrain.  lower mountain pod is all beginner terrain (serviced by a high speed quad!) that also has some excellent progression terrain parks thrown in for variety.  trails on this part of the mountain are about 3/4 of a mile long and there is even a beginner glade.
Please be wary of reviews of ANY New England ski  from December. December can become a feast or famine for snow conditions overnight. That said, Burke has an adequate amount of snow making to get most trails open by mid December just like any other major ski area. However, given Burke's northerly Latitude it does not have to depend on a huge snow making system to keep the mountain skiable. By late December, the natural terrain is usually open and skiable with excellent natural coverage (glades included).  natural terrain will typically stay open for the remainder of the season. Natural coverage, old New England style cruisers like East Bowl are a lot of fun (except for the run out :) .
Burke also does an excellent job with its groomed terrain. Cruisers like Dippers and Willoughby are outstanding for their snow quality, exciting rolling terrain, and great views of northern Vermont.
Don't let the extra drive time deter you (It is only an extra 40 minutes past the Ski 93 areas in NH). That extra 40 minutes is quickly made up for with very short (usually no) lift lines. Spend your time skiing, not standing in line (unless you really like standing around in line).
For expert skiers, Burke has an outstanding glade system. Long steep rolling glades like Jungle and Dixieland will have your quads screaming by the time you reach the bottom. Resorts like Jay Peak are well known for their glades but I think Burke is in the same class in this department.
Sure Burke is not a big flashy name that you can go home bragging to your friends about since they will probably reply ""where's that"". But come give it a try. All through January this year I skied on Saturdays and NEVER stood in a line and there was not a patch of ice to be found on the mt.n. re is live music in one of the two lodges every night during the weekend and on some weekdays as well. Bring the family, there is something for everyone.",bluemoon1975
6020,2009-03-22,New York,West Mountain,4,"Our family of five has traveled to a variety of skiing mountains within a 5 hour drive of our NJ Shore home.  We are primarily interested in finding mountains that are good for the entire family.  Of the many places we have been in PA, NJ and NY, West Mountain has been our favorite.   quality of the snow, natural and man made, is great.   trails are groomed well and there were only a very few ice patches.  Our youngest skiiers have taken lessons at many different mountains.   lessons they received at West were definately the best (instructors were Niki and Spencer).    bunny slope is a little bit isolated from the other trails unlike a place like Mountain Creek where high level skiiers ski through the lesson area.  

Everyone in our family found trails they liked.  and BEST of all, even on a beautiful sunny President's Day Weekend, we never waited in line for the chair lifts.  

In addition, for those who don't ski or for those who want a break from skiing, the tubing park is very fun.  But the tubing park can get very busy on weekends and waits can be long.  Go on Friday or Sunday evening.  ",bluemoon1975

This is not a big vert drop mountain but unlike Cooper its not so small that you can just let the kids run wild.

It has terrain for all ages and skill level. If you are a beginner stay on Dercum mt.n. where there is a lot of great blue and green terrain plus the biggest terrain park in the USA the A 51 terrain  park!
If you are an advanced skier stay on the North Peak the North Peak has a few blues and lots of black diamonds. If you are an intermediate skier head to the Outback where there is lots of blue runs it also has great tree runs plus Some Hike back terrain if you want to you can also pay 5$ to get a snow cat tour.  other hike to terrain is the Windows off of Dercum mt.n.  Windows services great tree runs.  food here is good we ate at the Outpost they had good food but don't eat there on a cold day because only registered guests are aloud to sit inside.  Outpost gondola is right by the restaurant it never has lines and has great views. While I was riding it a Bald Eagle started circling my cab that was so cool! Keystone is a great mountain to go to.

I've been there 4 separate days, and have yet to have the lift open for night skiing.  winds are high, so the upper lifts close a lot. Beginners might get annoyed that the green runs are in upper elevation, which is windier and sometimes closed.

As it turned out we all had a great time.    rooms were simple but clean offered enough room.   building is a bit of a maze but that did not bother us.   two restuarants were resonably priced and the food was good,  It started snowing on the way up and continued snowing until we had to leave so we skied on fresh powder the entire time.   price was   by far   the best I had found for slopeside accomodations.  I will seriously consider returning next year.  Keep in mind that this is not a fancy  but a good place for skiers of all ages   and especially families   to go.  

One word of caution.   access road is about 4 miles and it is steep in sections.  When it snows, it can be very difficult getting up the road if you do not have 4wd or snow tires.  I was driving a mini van and barely made it up there.  Plowing is handled by the town and I wish they attended to the access road a bit earlier   and more often   the night we arrived.

6071,2009-03-28,Minnesota,Lutsen Mountains,3,"I celebrated President's Day this year at Lutsen Mountains.  I was amazed at how dead it was  there couldn't of been more than 150 people.  Maybe most people were thinking that the recent warm up had made winter officially over.

Well, they are wrong.  Winter is here.  and Lutsen can prove it to you.

While the Twin Cities may look like it's the 15 of October (and smell like spring, yuck!), Lutsen is still a winter wonderland.  Snow sits in the trees, covers the branches, and the slopes are still soft.  So don't give up on the season just yet.

It's true that the warm up the last few weeks took it's toll: the runs are icy again at Lutsen.  But quality grooming equipment and luck of the draw lake effect snow is keeping Lutsen at the top of the pile for conditions.  When we skied Lutsen on Monday, we expected the worst...bare spots and ice...but what we got instead was soft and loose snow.

 runs at Lutsen did get melted a bit, but not nearly as bad as Spirit just south of Lutsen, and not even remotely as bad as the Twin Cities s.  You can still ski and have your edge not hit the icy slopes underneath.  Plus, there's no bare spots.   slope conditions aren't yet soft enough for hucking, so jump with caution...there *is* still ice underneath.

You won't hear the typical ""sssssscrape"" of edges on ice at Lutsen.  Instead, you'll be getting soft groomer turns on some sugary snow.

One thing you can rest assured of with this most recent melt down: Lutsen's base is here to stay.  at 50"" or so, it's compacted down and will be sticking around for a long time to come.

 lift situation at Lutsen continues to be a problem (they are slow), but I can't complain too much about that since we skied up and got on the chair every time due to the lack of people on the hill.   new lift for ski school is still not functional (although Lutsen claimed it would be by February), but that's not a big deal either as the lift is essentially pointless.

Papa Charlie's remains the one good location for apres ski.   climate inside the bar is great  the view is also incredible  and the prices are becoming reasonable.  Beer is down to an even $5 for a plastic glass full (it was $5.15), and the food prices have remained stable ($8 for a small personal sized pizza isn't unreasonable).  at times, I just wish there was MORE selection than Papa Charlie's.  I've seen signs for the ""Moguls"" restaurant and bar, but if it's the old ""Tracks"" restaurant that is in Caribou Highlands, I want nothing to do with that dump.  Maybe one day before the end of the season I'll get adventurous and check it out.  I'll report back here when I do.

I'll be going back to Lutsen a few more times this year, you can bet on that.   conditions are going to remain great for the rest of the season, and I think spring skiing there will be phenomenal.  Now I just really wish I had bought a season pass this year...",Richard Min
6073,2009-03-29,California,Palisades Tahoe,3,"I've been to this  several times, and each time I've asked myself why I bothered to come back.  night boarding/skiing is great IF you don't mind waiting 10 30 minutes in line at the tram to even get up the mountain.  rest of the time, the place is specifically designed for skiers, not snowboarders. When it comes to trails, they tend to bottom out and if you haven't maintained a fairly fast pace of speed you'll end up having to walk until you hit steeper terrain. This is one of the first places I boarded where I saw trails that went uphill (heavenly being the other ). It might seem like an exaggeration and though its no vertical face, trails that are flat or have a slight upward grade is not a place snowboarders want to be. 

A lot of the trails are very narrow meaning if you have someone ahead of you who's a little slower than yourself getting around them can pose a challenge. Lastly, and one major pet peeve for me is getting to the bottom of this mountain is a broad statement. It is easy to get lost and unlike many other s not all trails lead to the same bottom. I've found myself at three different sides of the mountain from the same lift and had to take the shuttle back to the village several times. 

Overall, it's a average to barely just above average  that has more bark than bite. ",alvlee01
6074,2009-03-29,California,Northstar California,4,"Having boarded at several s across the country, Northstar is now one of my favorites. I admit, it's not the most easily accessible as it is somewhat off the beaten path unlike its smaller sister in the south (Sierra), but the terrain is excellent for all levels. at base camp you have a various selection of places to shop and eat from the casual $5 10 range, on upwards to typical ski  prices. 

 mountain can be very deceptive; the diamond trails would be slightly steeper than an average blue course at any other major , while the blues tend to be just above greens, and the greens, though not as steep were good for casual riding and teaching friends. 

I especially appreciated the friendly staff when riding the gondola up to mid mountain they would happily remove my board from the rack and have it waiting for me when the doors opened. 

All in all, great experience.  only negative comments I can say about the  is: 
1) parking is horrendous. If you are not willing to pay $20 for VIP parking just below the village, then you'd have to park about 1/4 mile away and have a shuttle transport you. 
2)   gets extremely crowded, especially with wayward patrons who like to congest the ""slow"" areas of the park which makes getting around them a challenge for any snow veteran. Can't complain, it happens at every .
3)  ""slow"" signs conveniently placed at the beginning/end of each trail make it so you actually do have to slow down and navigate around the signs as they are literally spread across the face of the trail with a few feet of space to traverse around them
4)  Lastly, and probably the most aggravating is the lift ticket pricing. $79 is fairly over priced which is why I stopped going to places like Heavenly and Squaw...higher prices, no improvements. However, I found a convenient loophole around this: I paid $20 for a lifetime membership at REI which entitled me to discount lift tickets with no black out dates, also throughout the season they will supply you with discount vouchers that enable you to get all day passes for only $56 which is reasonable, and they also have the multi day discounts. But, if you're like me and you plan to hit the slopes just about every other weekend...season pass is the way to go. ",alvlee01
6075,2009-03-29,California,Heavenly Mountain,3,"I just bought a season pass to heavenly without going there.... BIG mistake!  Most of the runs are short and not steep at all for the intermediated and the black diamonds are not for snowboarders but for skiers. I guess if you ski, you would like it, but not if you snowboard.  re are A LOT of cat trails and you have to scoot your way from one end of the mountain to the other. Let's just say this is not the best place to snowboard if you really like snowboarding and not the best place for beginners.  only good thing is that the lifts are fast.",alvlee01

Big Boulder is great a night.  No crowds at all.  Overall, I think BB is more of a terrain park mountain, being that they have 6 terrain park areas, but only 2 greens, 1 blue and 3 blacks.",Gunny J

It was the first ski experience for my two kids, they actually exceeded my expectations by skiing an intermediate run before the end of their first day !  I am driven to write this review after reading numerous negative commentary about the staff, it's total BS.  We found them friendly and helpful to many who happen to take a tumble.  I am a firm believer that if you have a smile on your face, you'll get the same in return.   only thing they couldn't do was will the Snow Gods to drop some snow !

6112,2009-04-05,New York,Hunter Mountain,4,"You can tell you’re at Hunter, when at 08:15 am a car pulls up next to you in the parking lot and two mid twenty something males emerge as they knock off the remains a few cold ones.  I immediately took a note to give them wide berth if I spotted them anywhere on the slope.  I anticipated a frozen wash board surface based on the weeks spring like weather conditions that were quickly followed by a freeze, but was pleasantly surprised to encounter mostly groomed out surfaces with more than enough loose frozen granular on top to grab a nice edge.  As a rule, I do not ski Hunter on weekends due to the horrendous crowds, however, I still had my yet to be used (work and weather kept getting in the way of my mid week plans) Big Lift Card, and concluded it was deep enough into March to roll the dice and take a chance.   I am happy to say it paid off.   Crowds were not a problem and conditions were quite nice.    singles line at the high speed quad was 1 – 4 minutes at the worst and the other chairs had no lines.   sun was out and life was good.  Things started to soften up on the front side around 11am.  Softness did not arrive on the back side though until about 1:30 pm.  I learned this the hard way when I ventured down Clair’s about 11 am or so and met the icy surface with my body about half way down.  All things taken into account, it was a great day of skiing.  and even better, I never did encounter my parking lot buddies again.",Gunny J

We stayed halfway between Stowe and Smuggs, skiied both and Smuggs definitely wins that battle.  Much more acreage, better prices, more glades, and less people (what more could you ask for).  Only complaint I'd have is that the lifts are a little slower, no gondola or quads, but it just gives you more time to enjoy the beautiful scenery.  I recommend Smuggs to anyone no matter what world class s you've been to.",papi6022

You need to stay at the  when it snows since the road closes often and makes for the best days when everybody from salt lake can't come up there. Snowbird has a ton of steeps. cliffs and trees  to ski.  tram to the top gives you good lines in every direction. If it gets icy in the front then go to mineral basin in the back for better snow. Snowbird also has some great backcountry runs accessible off of Gad 2 lift in scottys bowl. Little Cottonwood Canyon is the most avalanche prone area in the lower 48 so bring you avalanche gear. Its April 7 today and they have 550 inches with 2 feet more in the forecast. Where else that has dry snow has that much besides snowbird's neighbors alta and solitude. Ride Utah,isaac reule
6122,2009-04-08,Colorado,Keystone,5,"First timer to Keystone with my first time snowboarding wife.  We stayed at Keystone for 5 days straight.  I was a good boy and stayed with my wife most of the time. LOL.  She went to snowboard school and had a horrible experience the first day.   instructor left my wife on top of Dercum Mountain by herself and never attempted to help her.  He just left her and went with the rest of the class down the mountain.  I was pretty pissed as I paid alot of money for the school.   2 day, I decided I was going to try to teach her the basics.  She was a trooper and tried to keep on learning even though her butt was really sore.  On the third day, we decided to go to the school front desk and explained what happened on the first day.  y spoke to the instructor and they gave us a voucher for a private lesson.    new instructor was a lifesaver and all in all, the ski school experience started off bad but they made up for it and resolved it by giving my wife  a private lesson (which was valued at $300.00).  Like I said, the new instructor was really nice, patient and did his job perfectly.  Kudos to him (wished I remembered his name).   That was really the only bad experience at Keystone.    Of course I didn't have the chance to ride the whole mountain since I was on good behavior and stayed with my wife most of the time.  But the mountain has lots of varied terrain that I hope to explore next time I visit Keystone.  I am going to give the Windows, the back side bowls  a try next time.  It looked pretty fun.  base (River Run) village area is a nice play to explore and eat at (expensive food). Mardis Gras was fun but I hear from the locals that Keystone is moving towards a complete family friendly Mardis Gras in the future. by the way, get the $3.00 Irish coffee at the coffee shop in River Run!!  tasty stuff!!   All staff were friendly and helpful at the  except for the first instructor we got.  Keystone has some great deals on the internet so be patient and wait till the deals come up.  We got a condo for $99.00 per night and lift tickets were $62.00 per day per person (the lift tickets get cheaper if you book lodging and lift tickets together).  Also night school was free for us (another great value),   I really chose Keystone because of the great deals and night skiing/snowboarding.   night boarding was awesome as I was able to get away and ride solo.   night views from top of Dercum is gorgeous!    All in all, I will visit Keystone again and will definitely explore the whole mountain.   

re is one more thang though that I have to talk about.  I used to ski in my teenager years and I love skiing as I think its fun and anything to do to be out in the slopes is all good with me.  Now, for the past 15 years I have been snowboarding.  I have ski'd and boarded at BC Whistler, Mammoth, all of the Lake Tahoe Resorts, Kirkwood, Socal s, Canyons UT, backcountry and so on I have been around the block.  I have never never ever have come across any skier vs. snowboarder BS but I guess there is a first for everything.  So here we are at Keystone and I have never experienced so much BS and boarder hating like I did at Keystone.  I have never gave any skiers any type of hate and actually enjoy my time with skiers/boarders.  We are all there to have fun and as long as we respect others (in the real world too), there shouldn't be any problems.  But no, those yuppie a$$ and dorky skiers (not all of them like I said I don't hate on anyone) who gave me and my wife crap because we are snowboarders need to be driven off the cliff.  se yuppies were so rude and disrespectful, I seriously was about to lose it and grab this one guy off the chairlift and slice his neck off with my snowboard edge.  But I kept my cool and wasn't going to let any dumb skier ruin my time there.   One skier actually physically assaulted my wife by throwing something from his bag at her head (there was no provocation on our part as we were just sitting on the beginner run since I was teaching my wife), this skier was about to get a elbow lock/break grab from me as he got off the chairlift, but my wife told me to cool down which I did.  Again,  what is up with all of this skier vs. snowboarder hate especially by the skiers.at Keystone.  I know I know, sometimes the jibbing is done in all innocent and goodfun (which I am game for) but once it gets to the point where they are trying to physically get at you, then its a different story.   Again   all you haters get off the bandwagon or go play on I 70.  That's my review and piece and again, Keystone is definetely recommended!!",J

6127,2009-04-09,Utah,Snowbasin,5,I have had the opportunity to visit a number of s in Colorado and Utah and I must admit I was really surprised at Snowbasin. It was the second time that I have been to the  (admittedly the first time was 10 plus years ago) but I was amazed at how much the  has changed. Obviously all of the upgrades were due to the Salt Lake City winter Olympics.  result though is a great intermediate / advanced  with a great variety of runs that any style of snowboarder or skier would enjoy.  thing that amazed me the most (having been to some of the supposed more exclusive s) was the on mountain dining facilities and the on mountain food. It felt more reminiscent of dinning in a restaurant than the crowded on mountain facilities that are experienced at most of the other s that I have been to. Along with on mountain food the price is significantly more reasonable priced than the other s. Overall coupled with the excellent sugar like powder that was experienced the whole day was a pleasant surprise which resulted in an awesome day had by us all.,Simon

 town of breckenridge is also super cool  its an old mining town that has its own charm with lots of great bars and places to eat. re is a 20 something crowd around town with a significant portion who's primary goals are to be ski bums, which makes it a lot more lively than many other ski towns I have visited. It's also not nearly as expensive to visit as Vail, Aspen or Big Sky.

6137,2009-04-12,Minnesota,Lutsen Mountains,5,"If you live in the midwest, you know that the weather has been less than conducive for skiing...but it's also spring.   recent ice storm left most areas stranded, and that would normally translate into certain doom for ski runs.  But not at Lutsen.  While Spirit Mountain just to the north plans to close this weekend, Lutsen is in great shape.

Yeah, be wary, because the snow is fast...it is, by and by, ice.  But it's good ice, I guess.  It's groomed well, but still little pellets of ice.  It's also groomed enough that it's deep enough to make turns...which is weird, because it's *ice*.  You can still slash some great turns, go fast, and have plenty of fun.  re's no bare spots, but there are very small spots of pure ice that you have to be wary.  But that's ok.  Because the best part, is...

...Lutsen still has plenty of base.  You'll be able to ski Lutsen, even after a big warm up, for a while.  Again, there's no bare spots, plenty of snow, and great grooming.  You don't have to worry about them closing any time soon.   snow is plentiful and in great shape for spring skiing, once it warms up.  re's some great turns that can be had coming soon.

Mystery Chair was still down today, but Lutsen is hoping to have it up by the weekend.  So if you're wondering why they are charging full price for a ticket, but only having 55 of the 90 runs open, it's probably because Mystery being out of commission is taking away a lot of the runs (all backcountry and glade runs are closed, because what snow there is is just unsafe to ski, hence the rest of the runs being closed).  But Upper and Lower Bull, Koo Koo, and Bridge runs are phenomenal right now.

Don't let the first day of spring make you think your ski season is done...because it's not.  Get out there and enjoy some great late season turns.",flatlander13

6142,2009-04-14,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"Breckenridge has become our family home away from home. Being an Australian who has relocated to Colorado for work we committed to learning to ski and snowboard during our time in the US. As such in 2007 the family (including at the time my six year old son) took skiing lesson followed in 2008 by the family taking snowboarding lesson. I believe that Breckenridge has to be one of the best places to learn to do both, not only for the terrain (which the mountain has a good variety of all terrain that you can progress through as abilities improve) but more so for the fabulous instructors that we had for both skiing and snowboarding.  ability of all of the instructors (that includes the instructors that taught my son) were second to none and they seem to be thoroughly knowledgeable, patient, understanding and most of all were great people that had fun with the students. I especially loved my day hiking (up to 45 mins at a time) with one of the instructors to some of the off beat runs and snowboarding through thigh deep powder. I definitely attribute the fun that our family has had to these instructors and there ability to teach. As a result I love now going on extreme terrain with my now seven year old son and experiencing something that is for me a once in a lifetime experience.

P.S. If you have never skied or snowboarded before I recommend lessons and highly recommend the instructors at Breckenridge. With lessons it won't be long until you are having some of the best fun imaginable.",dancinjrl
6146,2009-04-15,Vermont,Bromley Mountain,5,"Spent 3 days of snowboarding at Bromley in February.   first day we were there, the Express Quad was not running, so we were not able to take full advantage of the mountain.   conditions were good, although some crusty areas. Conditions got better throughout the day with the sun coming down on it.

It started raining late in the afternoon and rained all night.   next morning, the conditions on the mountain were not very good and the  was offering half price tickets.  I thought this was a nice gesture.  I had not heard of any mountains that lowered their prices due to conditions.  It usually is ""at your own risk"".   express quad did not open until around noon.   conditions really weren't all too bad considering they had spent all morning grooming the trails.
 green Run Around trail was very nice and long, but it was pretty icy at the top with some bare spots showing.
 blue trail Pushover is another great trail, with awesome views on the side of the mountain.   one gripe I have about this trail is, if you are a snowboarder, that once you get to the bottom and go on Chase It and lose a lot of speed, it is difficult to maneuver through this trail because it is pretty flat.

 beginner terrain park had a small jump and two small rails.  I thought that the first rail was too narrow for a beginner to learn on, plus it was not all straight.  re should really be a long, wide, straight rail for beginners.

All the blue trails were great for cruising.  It is unfortunate that the only long green trail runs from the top of the mountain. So, if the Express Quad is not running, there are not many options for beginners.

I found that the best conditions were from 10am onward.  Around 3 or 4pm, the snow gets nice and soft, but then the  closes.  y should really stay open a little later because unlike other mountains nearby, the snow didn't ice up so early.

  offered Valet parking which unheard of.  We didn't take advantage of it.   parking lot is not that far away, plus there is a shuttle that comes by frequently.

 lodge was okay, nothing real spectacular.  Parts of it weren't even serving food.  We just packed sandwiches and drinks and brought them back from the car and ate outside on the lounge chairs.  

We stayed in Manchester Center which is a short drive from the mountain.  It was a great place to stay because the Shopping Outlets were there, as well as many other stores and a grocery store.

Also, if you are looking for discounts,  some of the Otter Creek beer cases had a Mid Week 2 for 1 coupon in them.  We took advantage of this. It's always great to save some money.

We stayed in a condo in the village that had a great kitchen but was a little bit of an uphill walk.   walk was tiring at the end of the day, but the kitchen and accomodations were worth it.

We were there on the first weekend of the President's week holiday.  re were no lift lines until Sunday afternoon when they got to be about 5 minutes.

But I have to say that the people that run Dodge Ridge get the absolute most out of 800 acres.  

I'm still learning in the terrain park, so I was on the ""little features"" when I went for it.  y were so small, even going in hot it was hard to get the amplitude to really stomp something cool.   medium features were a bit too much for me, and a progression park would have been great.   parks were in top notch condition but just need that stepping stone from the kiddie jumps to the 15 footers. 

Great grooming as well, everything from the greens to the double blacks were a blast and the linking of trails here should be the case study for other s.

6168,2009-05-19,California,Heavenly Mountain,5,"Spent 1 day of 6 skiing days at Heavenly.  

One of our trip days was driving around the lake, where we stopped at SaveMart Supermarket, 100 River Road, Tahoe City, 96145 near Squaw Valley USA.  SaveMart sells discounted lift tickets for Heavenly.  For 2 A 3 K, saved $39 for 1 day lift tickets.

 views from First Ride lift and Poma Trail run are outstanding for a green run.  Our group is all beginners and we had a fun time at Heavenly.  We stretched our skills on the Mombo run, California side.   last section of Mombo is quite steep and is a ""green section"" of the Powderbowl Woods (blue).  Be prepared to do a lot of turning to control speed, but well worth the challenge.

People we encountered were courteous and respectful of our slow moving group.  We were there on a weekday, which I am certain helped.   best access to green runs are from the California Lodge.  We used the bus to get from the Gondola base to the CA lodge and the wait times were very reasonable.   bus at the end of the day was standing room only, which was challenging with 3 kids and equipment.   Orange bus goes between the Gondola and CA Lodge.

 Gondola only allows access to 1 green run (Big Easy lift/Easy Street run), which was a nice warm up to have some great views.  Other have posted comments on the staircase down from the Gondola at Top of the Gondola.  Yes, it is high, yes it is steep, yes it is ""entertaining"" to traverse with 3 kids and equipment.  Could it be made better, not in mountainous terrain!   views from the Gondola are worth the time to ride up and back down.

 runs we encountered were well maintained.  We encountered ice in the shadows, but it was due to the warm weather during the days (50 F +) and below freezing at night (15   20 F).   Mombo run had quite a few trees, so it had more ice than I would have liked.

When we arrived at the CA base lodge, a Heavenly Employee immediately greeted us and explained where the lifts were, walked us through the building and made recommendations for lifts/runs.  I was thoroughly surprised at the outstanding service.  We arrived later in the afternoon (1:30   2:00), so they were not extremely busy at that time.  We had spent the morning on the Gondola and several runs on Easy Street.

If you are a beginner skiier and want to enjoy some Heavenly skiing... (Day 3 + of skiing) Start your day at CA lodge base, take Gunbarrel Express to Patsy's, ski down Patsy's (easy green), rest at Snow Beach for a bit, take Powderbowl Express lift to top of mountain, work way down on either Mombo or Maggie's.   first signs you will follow are for Maggie's and then follow signs for Mombo.  Again, end of Mombo is steep and requires some switchbacking to control speed.  Enjoy the afternoon on a ride up the Gondola, a couple trips on Easy Street and enjoy those views!

If you are an intermediate/advanced skiier   enjoy yourself   there are TONS of blue runs.  I should see you next year!",mir0yan222

6209,2009-08-27,California,Bear Mountain,4,"Hi All:  
      Just returned from a week of calm sunshine, minimal lift lines and 10 feet of well groomed packed power at good Old Bear Valley, CA. We stayed in a cabin down the road but I did see great deals for rentals if just visiting for a few days. 

   This place has a cosy old school feel about it with warm genuine staff eager to insure all riders and skiers are having the best that Stanislaus National Forrest and Bear valley can provide.

   We had to notice Bear is feeling the effects of the current economic downturn. 

Zero lift lines (and I mean nobody) and similar densities in the parking lot with all that sweet deep is surreal for anyone accustomed to the opposite. 

Add to that great deals on ski and board equipment in their sport shop and a cook that makes a 4 forks bowl of chili and the inescapable conclusion will emerge you need to support this venerable institution. Come get some! 

In closing, plan to visit Bear Valley California soon because there are less than 30 days remaining in the 2008/ 2009 ski season and to add your support to my plan to add a Starbucks kiosk in the lodge to further delight people like myself loving their daily coffee.   ",Burtoncustomjon
6211,2009-08-28,Wisconsin,Alpine Valley Wisconsin,4,"I really like Alpine Valley.  Of the places close to Chicago land, this is my favorite.   have conveyor belts for the beginners (several of them in different areas), plus a good selection of green and blue runs.  y also have some blacks.   hill isn't too high, but what do you expect for southern Wisconsin.  

 Lodge is nice, and they have a decent bar (with OK food).  Prices are reasonable.  

 terrain parks are well maintained, they have some good sized jumps and some (not many) rails.  All the runs are separated by trees, which I like.

Overall, a good place to go.  Worth the extra drive from Wilmot.",Peter Mende
6212,2009-08-31,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,4,"I have a long relationship with Snowshoe, and we visit on the shoulder of nearly every holiday season. But our trip just after New Year's was disappointing this year. Fresh from a thaw, with intense cold, the  needed to make the most of a snowmaking opportunity. But did they have to do it on key trails that were already well covered? re seemed nowhere to escape the guns, even as key slopes such as Widowmaker and Upper Shay's stood bare. We made a single run down our beloved Cupp's Run   the best hill south of New York, at least   and almost died.  snow was uneven, and visibility under guns honking on the steeps was downright dangerous.  hill is closed for 16 of every 24 hours. That seems enough time to lay down snow, when other, nearby slopes are naked   especially when the base on most of the hill was measured in yards.  grooming was also uneven and haphazard, adding to the danger of iced goggles. Moreover, nestled amid some of the most impoverished counties in the U.S., the  nevertheless seemed to have sought out young, imported labor, presumably with H1B visas. I'll bet the local chamber and governments are pleased that all their economic development efforts have generated opportunities for young folks from Chile.  general impression I got at Snowshoe was that owner Intrawest is saving pennies wherever it can, cutting back on grooming and running a skeleton snowmaking crew that can't switch guns from one slope to another in the course of the day. y attitude seemed to be ""build a huge whaleback"" before moving on, leaving plenty to plow down on the hill in late March, when the real estate shoppers show up. I think it's great that Snowshoe is concerned about a long season, but it shouldn't come with such an impact on the comfort and safety of those who ski during prime time. I also think it's great to invite new folks to discover our country. I support the stated goals of H1B visas. But keeping wages low in a depressed area is not among them.",Unionhawk
6214,2009-09-03,Michigan,Ski Brule,5,"Brule Rocks!!! you can't beat spring skiing/boarding at Brule!  We just spent a weekend there and can't believe how reasonable the pricing is.  Considering how much everything around us keeps going up, ticket prices, lodging prices and food at ski brule are still affordable.  We took advantage of their friends and neighbors program and the $55/car load specials and skied practically for free.   snow was great and the staff is the best around   if you haven't been here you don't know what you are missing...Can't wait for next year!",mkt
6215,2009-09-07,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,3,"A basin is one of the harder ski areas in the US. It only has a few green runs, but lots of blue runs off of the Lenawee lift and the Norway lift. re is only one blue off of the Pallavicini lift and there is about five blues in the Montezuma bowl but the access to that is terrible. re is no pay parking here!  parking is very convenient.  High Noon lot gets pretty full most of the time, but it usually never fills up completely. If your an advanced/expert skier wanting to try a double black I would either go on the Zuma Cornice or the Pallavicini. If you take the Pallavicini the easiest double black to go on would be Pali Main Street. at the beginning of the day the Exhibition lift gets busy so if you are Intermediate or better go on the Pallavicini because there is a blue called Grizzley Road.
If you are going to eat go to the Black Mountain Lodge and get their Maccaroni and cheese it is great for mountain food. A basin is a great ski area",JakeS513
6216,2009-09-07,Colorado,Loveland,4,"I took my fiance, who had never skied before, and she did great.   easy slopes are awesome for beginners, mostly because they are not crowded and there is plenty of room to mess up, which she did many times!  Now for me, I ski the ridge.   vertical is tremendous and so is the view, especially from the divide.  It is usually windy and bone chilling there, but I highly advise getting a few pictures if possible.   ride up is long and cold, so bundle up, especially when the sun isn't out and the wind is blowing.  Make sure if you are high intermediate to advanced you head over to the north side.  It's not the easiest to get over there, you almost have to cross country ski in some places, but it's worth it, nobody goes over there!  Loveland seems to always have great snowfalls in late March and even all the way into mid April (which is usually the time I go), so you are almost always assured great fresh powder.  When I first starting skiing a while back, I spent a lot of time skiing Copper, Breckenridge, Keystone, Winter Park, etc., you know the big s!  y all have great memorable runs, but I'm kind of selfish.  I love the locals (even though I'm not one!) and the smaller crowds much better and that's what keeps me coming back to Loveland and also Arapahoe, which is only up the road about 20 min.  Those two places are the only ones in Colorado where I get compliments, not laughs, at my all camo ski gear.  What can I say, I like to be a little different!

6227,2009-09-16,Vermont,Killington,4,"Killington is under new ownership as of two seasons ago and is suffering through significant changes that have resulted in a serious loss of quality skiing. Many lifts don't run midweek and most lodges are basically closed (bathrooms and tickets only).  season has been shortened from the expected 7 month season to a mere 5 month season ending in mid April. This means earlier trail closures in the spring and less snow making all winter long (since it doesn't have to last till June). Businesses on the access road are hurting for late season business and closing earlier and earlier.  once mighty nightlife is dwindling. Skier visits are now sub 500,000 a year down from a peak of 1.3 millionish just a few years ago. People are moving on to longer seasons with better skiing at other s in Vermont... We own property and are upset with the way the new owners are running the mountain. Season passes are up over 200% in the last couple years. We are ready to move on, but must sell the condo first. Beware, the once mighty Killington is no more. 

1.) 3000 vertical feet. Well kinda, the only way to ski 3000 feet is on beginner trails.

2.) 7 giant peaks. Well kinda, Killington Peak, Snowdon Peak, Bear Mountain, Sky Peak, Rams Head, and Pico (and Sunrise?). But Rams Head lift doesn't go to the top of that peak and the peak is 'closed'. You can't even get to Pico and back from Killington on skis.  rest of the giant peaks top out at 1000' 1500' of vertical at best, 1/3 to 1/2 the size Killington touts.

3.) 6 great lodges. Well kinda, Peak lodge (which I expected to be the cool spot to hang out) was closed 90% of the time. Food at Bear Mountain Lodge and Killington Lodge was nothing short of gross. Never made it to Ramshead, Snowshed had better food options, but you had to deal with skiing with all the beginners to get in and out of there. Skyship base wasn't much more than a convenience store. and you can't get to Pico from Killington.

4.) Largest snowmaking system on the planet. Well I guess so. we never saw it operate during our two week holiday.

5.) Most chairlift capacity in New England? Could be, except we never saw half of them run. More ran on Saturdays, but some never ran the whole time we were there.

6.) Best nightlife in NE ski country? God I hope not.  bars remind me of Bourbon St in New Orleans the week after Mardi Gras. Dirty, dingy, run down, stinking of old beer (or was that urine) and don't even bother if it's not Friday or Saturday nights. Week day nights are quiet. Venturing into the city of Rutland was scary, at least at the nudie clubs.

Overall, I give Killington a 4 out of 10. re is some good skiing, but it's not what they claim. If you are there for anything other than the skiing, you have made a mistake.

6231,2009-09-24,Colorado,Vail,4,Vail lives up to the best Colorado has to offer.  number of acres far exceeds all other s and offers lots of space to get lost. We went during Christmas and it snowed 8 of 10 days. Spring break was sunny but still plenty of snow. We just missed the big spring dump!  Blue Sky Basin and the back bowls are the place to be. We've hit them all in Colorado and while there's plenty of great spots none beats Vail. You have to go to Whistler to find more terrain! ,Justin Howell

6234,2009-09-24,Michigan,Norway Mountain,4,"Ober Gatlinburg is kind of a mixed bag.   rentals, lessons, and lift tickets are cheap compared to other s and mountains, but you’re getting exactly what you pay for.... 

I actually got on a snowboard for the first time here, and at the price of $20 for a lesson you can’t expect much.  I learned some really small basic things, but the lesson was over in an hour.   After that, I felt like the beginner area was so crowded I just decided to call it quits.  re were so many people that it was hard to move 5ft without someone cutting me off, and they didn’t teach me anywhere near enough to go on a slope.  I ended up going to CO in January and my instructors told me they didn’t feel like I’d learned much of anything.. 

So after my experience here, I definitely wouldn’t recommend Ober Gatlinburg to someone who really wants to learn how to Ski or Snowboard.  But, if you know what you’re doing and already have your equipment it won’t break your bank to go.  ",mkt

6241,2009-09-29,Vermont,Killington,4,"Everything about this place whether pro or con, comes with a caveat. Except the price to ski here which is just plain absurd for the level of service they are willing to provide. I'm happy to support any area willing to support a great day for me as a skier on their hill. This is one of a very few places where I'm happier to buy somebody's extra day in the parking lot. Run the damn Canyon Chair during the week rather than make your customers take the runout of doom every time they'd like to ski something off the peak please. Anyhow, caveats; the terrain is fantastic and expansive. y claim 3000+ vertical feet and 7 peaks. Most of those peaks ski like mid size day hills by themselves and, the most vertical you will get in one good run is about 1600' on Killington Peak itself. (See runout of doom) n again, the tree skiing is almost top tier for Vermont, the steeps are pretty steep and, the bumps are pretty bumpy. It does get crowded but, once familiar with the place, you can sneak away on even the busiest weekend. You can party like it's 1999 on the access road but, you better have a designated driver. You get the idea, good skiing and good fun is certainly possible if you make it happen. ASC started a whole lot of lousy practices that put up some roadblocks to the whole good skiing and good fun thing. n again, the beer man was demanding cash on delivery before they folded. Credit where it's due, POWDR replaced the Skye Peak Chair. With a whole lot more cash on hand than ASC, some of which they should probably put back into the hill and operations to make better ski days for us to justify their pass and ticket prices, they have done absolutely nothing else. Except terminate lifetime passes for the hill's founding investors that is. I'm not one but, I think it's still a petty move that just helps me hate the hill that I've always used for its skiing just like it's always used me for my wallet a little more. In case you wondered, I'll probably be there in November. ",Justin Howell

6262,2009-10-13,Michigan,Nubs Nob,5,"Well now I return to review Nubs Nob once again as the season has ended for them. I also found the poster who put all of 3 sentences up and gave Nubs Nob only 2 stars to be extremely disrespectful. Back your statements up with reasoning.

I have visited Caberfae, Boyne Mountain / Highlands, Schuss Mountain (Schuss / Summit), Cannonsburg, Timber Ridge, Bittersweet, and Crystal Mountain.

Lift capacity   Nubs Nob wins. y have lifts EVERYWHERE. y let you ski under the lifts and they leave this area, among others totally ungroomed. On powder days these are a blast. Not many places have been able to offer the minimal wait time combined with convenient access (aka no cross country skiing to your lift).

Terrain park   No one maintains a superpipe in the L.P as well as Nubs Nob.  terrain park has 2 lifts if you include the superpipe lift. y have endless boxes, rails, and a few jumps.  only thing they could use more are more jumps with big air in mind. y keep their features maintained pretty good as well.

Downhill    terrain is varied. y have the largest amount of gladed skiing in the L.P, and they only rope off areas they do not own it seems. y have extremely long easy runs. A lot of the blue hills are extremely wide so if you need some space to play, they have it.  blacks are what you would expect in a black, and they offer some of the most vertical rise you can find. Boyne Highlands has nothing on Nubs Nob in terms of difficulty, and the same for Boyne Mountain if you ask me. Lets also not forget Nubs Nob's arsenal of snow making equipment. y changed the game for snow making. If they are open, they have snow...everywhere. Fake snow sucks usually, but Nubs Nob has some of the best fake snow. Go read the ski magazines and see them report on Nubs Nob and its superior snow making abilities. ir own patented guns...260+ in all. y could use more moguls (how many areas do you need for moguls though, Crystal Mountain?) I guess. Another fun thing about Nubs is the land is shaped just perfect so you are hardly ever cross country skiing to your runs / lifts.

Nubs Nob sells you one thing, snow. Not a hotel room, not this apres' ski spend all your money at the  game. You want to ski / snowboard, you want Nubs Nob. 

After traveling the state....I like to make the most of my time spent. If someone has a better ski area, please suggest it. But as it stands in the L.P Nubs Nob wins. Petoskey is great, and you can stay / dine for much cheaper than any  will be.

Oh yeah, heres another big bonus. Tired of skiing and want to sit in a lodge and watch your family ski? Nubs Nob has a lodge looking directly at the hill. A couple family members of mine like to sit in a lodge from time to time, and Nubs Nob has the most down to earth lodge...with the best views of the hills. Boyne Highlands, Boyne Mountain, Caberfae, not so much. y have lodges, but the lay of the land prohibits you from really relaxing and watching people ski.

I wish all snow areas took skiing as seriously as Nubs....the world would be a better place.",Matt Woodruff

6268,2009-10-15,Michigan,Schuss Mountain,4,"I find Schuss Mountain to be in the top 3 ski hills / s in Michigan.  place has it all, fine dining, lodges overlooking ski hills, great downhill terrain, superb lift capacity, just enough park.

y really are Boyne Mountains only competition in terms of  skiing in the Lower Peninsula.  place has some awesome runs, and pretty challenging blues and blacks.

y had a well maintained half pipe both times I was there.  lift lines were short, and they had lifts everywhere you wanted one.

You can find better deals at Schuss Mountain than you can at Boyne Mountain. Especially on liftopia.com. This place is awesome to go to for the price ($28.99 per person or so)

This place is definitely worth checking out @ $28.99 lift tickets during peak season. You factor in cost and Boyne / Nubs Nob begin to look less appealing if you are on a budget.",Matt Woodruff
6277,2009-10-20,Michigan,Marquette Mountain,5,"Maybe I was just at MM at the wrong time.  Grooming was suspect and lots of ice patches.   Visually, the hill seemed old and not well kept with lots of areas in need of the natural visual intangibles other hills already have to draw us to them.  Its as if MM started to work on slope improvements and quit halfway thru, it feels like parts of the hill are just left undone, like a construction zone in progress.   On the plus side, MM gets LOTS of snow thanks to its proximity to Lake Superior, but still doesn't open earlier or stay open later into the season than any other hill.  Terrain is better than some hills in the area, but you can end up traversing flat areas to get from one part of the hill to another, so plan to get some exercise that doesn't include just enjoying the gravity.  Bright spot, Ski Patrol is top notch.  I hate to say it, but my daughter came off a lift wrong and injured her knee.  NSP was first class getting her off the hill, and one of the NSP at MM is a trauma nurse at the local hospital.  Couldn't have asked for better care in a crummy circumstance, thank you NSP, YOU ROCK!.   Food is good and reasonable, decent guest service but not a class leader.  Ok, like I said, maybe I was there at the wrong time, so I WILL give it another shot.   For now its a place to ski, but not necessarily my first choice.  If the next trip improves my experience, I will update and give credit where its due. ",Matt Woodruff
6278,2009-10-20,Michigan,Mt. Holiday,3,"I first skied at Holiday in 1967 as a student of the Traverse City Record Eagle ski school.  Thus began my love affair with skiing.  I have so many wonderful memories of skiing at Holiday and the runs of the day:  Marvelling at the peaceful view over East Bay from Ridge Run, moguls on Pepi, thrills in Coffin Canyon, learning how to stem christie on Snowshoot, mastering parallel skiing on Upper and Lower Holiday.  Hours spent socializing with friends in the lodge after a great ski over hot chocolate and a grilled cheese sandwich; these are the things memories are made of.

6283,2009-10-22,Vermont,Killington,5,"Let me preface my review by stating that if you can at all avoind going here on the weekends, then do so.  I think being the first ""big""  you get to driving from the south attracts the huge weekend crowds.

Terrain    terrain here is varied and has some nice supprises for all levels.  From the beginner slopes at the Snowshed area to the double diamonds on Killington Peak and Bear Mountain.   trail map marks a lot of the black runs as Double Diamonds but don't let that scare you away because they use to be single Diamonds but have mysteriously become doubles.   It is a huge are in general and you can continue to find new terrain after many visits.

Lodging/Nightlife   I'm not the type of person who choses where I ride based off of what else there is to do, but if I was, I'd probably avoid Killington.   base are has a lodge/restauraunt/hotel and thats really it.  All the restauraunts/bars are down the road and you have to drive or cab it to get from place to place.  You don't really get the ""Ski Town"" feel at all when your there, so if thats what your looking for go to Stowe.",Dylan
6285,2009-10-22,Colorado,Keystone,5,"On the Colorado Pass Keystone is far and away my favorite .  It is definitely that: a .  From Radio Flyer wagons in the parking lot to haul kids or gear or both, to the new faster gondola, Keystone is an appealing  to families.  Additionally, for all the powder hounds, hikers, park rats, and mogul junkies, Keystone does an excellent job of separating the crowds, as opposed to Breckenridge where every FULL run essentially dumps the skiier at one or two places.   3 mountain separation of Keystone is crucial.  A51 is a sick park and it also does a killer job of separating the first time jibbers from the invert skiiers.  My personal favorite feature of Keystone is the hiking/snowcat terrain above Dercum Mountain (the windows, independence bowl...), North Peak (Bergman Bowl), and all of the Outback.   only downside is that they have kept up with Vail, BC, and Breck in the $90+ ticket for a mountain that can occasionally hurt for snow.  Keystone lodging, however, is generally less expensive than their counterparts.",JP

6321,2009-11-07,Vermont,Sugarbush,5,"After skiing practically every mountain in Vermont, this place somehow put a spell on me and I couldn't stay away! From the very start to the end of the season, conditions are always well managed despite the finicky weather experienced in the Northeast. Instead of writing an essay, heres some key bullets on pro's and con's for the mountain:
Pros:
> Terrain nicely spreads crowds, with very few (if any) dangerous intersections. Even on packed holiday weekends, there are many line free lifts. 
> Moguls, moguls, moguls! Many of the great trails are very nicely bumped up   unlike many other places in the east, this place keeps a good amount of trails un groomed. 
> Terrain variety is unmatched in the east   between both base areas.. you can not ski the same trail for a whole weekend; even after 2 years here I am still finding new ""stashes""
> Lot's of off trail ""hidden"" gems, and ""back country"" excursions (such as slide brook) that make this place not just your ordinary ski . If you like to explore, this place is endless. 
> Vertical drop (2,600ft) is for real ; unlike other s that post #'s that are additive and not continuous, here it is, and top to bottom skiing is a real leg burner. A true run from the top of Mt. Ellen to the base is truly a 20+ minute excursion and very reminiscent of western s. 
> Lifts are staggered across at different elevations, and allow you to ski where it's best. For example, if more snow fell higher up in elevation you can stay on lifts high up and do laps in the good stuff; if it's cold and crusty up top, and warmer/softer conditions are only towards the base, you can do laps on the lower lifts and avoid the icy conditions. This is sometimes hard at other s (i.e.: Stowe) where most lifts go all the way to the summits.
> Place has great snow preservation; snow doesn't blow off trails easily, good aspect away from sunshine
> Apre ski is actually better than you think, good crowds, bands, etc. 
> On mountain lodges are great! 
> Free hot cider at the end of the day; friendly staff.. what more could you want

Cons:
> Slide Brook Express was down a lot last season; hopefully this won't happen again
> Resort could add additional glades; although there are some great tree runs, the  definitely isn't tapping into its potential
> Adding some more high speed lifts/gondola to the mix would be nice (i.e.: Heaven's Gate, Lynx, and Ellen Summit areas)
> Terrain Park   definitely lacking; I don't think the half pipe was even constructed this past year. 
> Hard to think of any more... 

If you haven't been, I'd strongly recommend visiting. It truly is worth the extra drive. ",Canadian
6326,2009-11-08,Vermont,Jay Peak,5,"close to montreal, its worth the drive for the terrain. always snowing. seems like there is no one on the hill, a lot less populated then s in the area.",Canadian
6327,2009-11-08,Vermont,Mad River Glen,5," stumps, bolders and other obstacles haven't been cleared (at least not from the advanced terrane) to facilitate snowmaking and grooming.   result is the best and most authentic skiing experience in the east.  Lifts go top to bottom, so the runs are long and vertical.  Uphill capacity is limited so you won't see a lot of people on your way down.  No out of control snowboarder is going to crash into your kids here . . . in fact, snowboard are not allowed at all!  

Don't imagine this to be a secret though . . . the signature single chair probably has the longest lines in the state during holidays and weekends when the snow is good.

It is a beautiful little place.  staff was friendly and helpful and they met our expectations. Having a nursery on site made possible for us to enjoy it.   kids program is good. My 6 year old son, saw snow for the first time and he was skiing by the end of the day. I would go back again.

6330,2009-11-08,North Carolina,Sugar Mountain,4,"Given the level of suffering and danger generated by the impressive arsenal of snow machines, they must be the first item mentioned.  Sugar Mountain is not willing to cease and desist snow machine operation even during the brief 4 hour night session, forcing you the skier to deal with deafening noise, wiping your goggles from a blinding coat of machine induced ice crust whilst skiing and, finally, dodging the machine induced wet spots that can and will stop you dead in your tracks just as if you had hit a short fence.  While the desire to make as much snow as possible could potentially be understandable given the southern location, the way in which snow making is being carried out is both dangerous, loathsome and just plain no fun.  Additionally, even when there is a minimum coverage of over 30 inches, Sugar Mountain still blows the snow guns on powder days on every single slope, leaving you the skier unable to enjoy what Mother Nature so graciously deposited(the sometimes fluffy powder having been ruined by crappy machine snow).  Hint:  Avoid the snow machines like the plague they are or become an expert at the wipe&ski.   hill itself is steep and surprisingly awesome given its location.   blacks are legit; the vertical drop is enough for a quad burn; the terrain park is worth hitting, and the bunny slopes are some of the best around for learning on.   place can get crowded to the point of madness, especially when you factor in the slow lifts, dangerous snow guns and ice/bare spots.   on mountain grub is pricey but good, and the student discounts can be helpful to some.  Avoid weekends after 12pm, snow guns, wet spots under the guns, ice, bare spots and newbies that traverse the whole slope every 20 feet and you might just have yourself a good time.  Not a good  for making random stops on the slope either; you may very well get smacked at high speed by someone in camo and blue jeans.    is much easier to access than Beech Mt. on snow days due to its easily accessible base, and it's closer to Banner Elk for the apres ski thing(not many options there, although there is a bar on site upstairs in the lodge).  Check out Big Red if you want to feel like you're in a video game, and don't forget to turn around on the lift to take in the amazing view of Grandfather Mountain and beyond.  Good luck.",Heather

Upper and backside areas are a wide open playground for advanced skill levels.    is huge, so there is plenty of room to spread out.  I highly suggest the peak and backside terrain.

My visit was over the new year, and it wasn't crowded at all, except maybe midday at the lone peak tram/ bottom of the bowl area.  Plan your trip to the peak early, and be prepared for the weather up there to be different from the lower mountain (windy, low visibility).

6346,2009-11-11,Michigan,Boyne Mountain,4,"Well a great time was had this last Sunday at Boyne Mountain.

Pros

 great lift capacity (small lines)
 decent terrain park
 a big  so dining / lodging is not a problem 
 good amount of runs
 runs for all levels of ability
 gladed areas
 buildings to warm up / cool down at on top of the hills / midway down the hills.

I have been to all of the bigger s / hills in the L.P of Michigan. I find Boyne to be in the top 3, and probably one of the most family friendly s.

If you want a big  weekend, go to Boyne over Crystal. Crystal has much longer lines, and what seems like less lift capacity.

Cons
 the green runs are basically separated from the black / blue runs, so riding the lift up with friends of all levels can sometimes be a challenge.
 they had a decent amount of gladed skiing, but there were a lot of good spots roped off that looked to be used quite often, just by people who do not follow the rules. 
 while the lift capacity is great and the lines are small, you won't exactly escape the crowds entirely.

re is a positive to the green trails being isolated from the black trails. You do not have advanced skiers weaving through the greens very often, and you do not have beginners in areas they shouldn't really be in.

I would say they do a great job at providing Nubs Nob / Schuss Mountain / Crystal Mountain competition.

If I had to choose a top 3 for lower peninsula I would say...

1. Nubs Nob
2. Boyne Mountain
3. Schuss Mountain",A. cooper
6349,2009-11-11,Montana,Whitefish Mountain,4,"4 of us (2 couples) in our 30's visited Whitefish over presidents day week friday to friday.  We stayed at Crestwood condo's between town and the .  We rode the train in from Minnesota.  Didn't rent a car so we relied on the ski bus to get to the mt.n and taxi to get to town.  Each taxi trip was about $10. We spent far less this route rather than renting a car. All the bus drivers were very friendly and gave us good tips for enjoying the area while not skiing. In turn we tipped them well also.  Of the 3 skiers and 1 boarder we all enjoyed the diversity of the terrain.  I am a significantly more advanced skiier that the others.  On the first morning all of us took a ski with a couple of the Embassadors to get a good look at the mt.n.  I would suggest this for your first trip to the mt.n.  We skiid together for the first day then my wife and I wanted to tackle some more advanced terrain. It worked great to split up and plan on meeting for luch at the Hellroaring Saloon.  Great staff, food and booze. On the 3 day after staying up too late and many too many cocktails the others decided it'd be a good day for the hot tub, pool and a stroll around town.  Not me, I was there to ski hard.  That morning I hooked up with an Embassador again for an introduction to more advanced terrain since my wife was not allong.   Embassador was great and took me into the trees for some incredibly deep lines.  She also showed me some good intermediate trees to get my wife into some pow for next few days.  We did have some fog to deal with but not bad, like the other posters have mentioned it is pretty easy to find good visibility somewhere on the mt.n.  re were definately a good number of people on the mt.n over the weekend but we nearly had the place to ourselves the rest of the week.  Never did we wait more than 5 minutes for a chair anywhere on the mt.n, even on the busiest days.  My favorite advanced areas where the hellroaring basin, east rim and elephants graveyard.  re was a lot of great intermediate terrain that I could slide off into the bumps and trees and reconnect with my wife at the end of the run.  I would have liked to have better conditions to ski the advanced terrain on the front side.  It was pretty chunky and no one was skiing it.  back was incredible though.  All in all we had a great experience at Whitefish Mountain .  I definately like the lack of the ""show"" crowd.  You know, the look at me and my fancy car, fancy equipment, fancy clothes and no skill type!  I will definately go back.  But living in the plains and only getting to the mt.ns once a year makes me want to check out other ski areas before going back to Whitefish.  What it comes down to is go up the mt.n, ski hard, party, have fun, respect others and be thankfull God has given us the opportunity to experience such a beautiful mountain!",Mike Barrett
6351,2009-11-13,New Mexico,Ski Santa Fe,1,I go to school in Albuquerque and love to take trips to Santa Fe whenever I can.

6353,2009-11-15,New Hampshire,Bretton Woods,1,"Spend you money and time elsewhere. Paid over $70 per ticket to stand in singles lines for 25 30 minutes a pop. For whatever reason, they have half of the mountain closed every time I go there, and for no specific reason. I have been to this mountain numerous times (about 2 3 weekends per year for the past 4 years), only to be disappointed again and again. I go because my girlfriend's is at a beginner level, because of an old ACL injury, which is all this mountain is decent for. y do get decent snow because of the location, but no better than many of the other surrounding mountains. But the poor, poor customer service I witnessed the last time I was there shocked me, and I will never return again!

Spend your hard earned money elsewhere. re are so many better mountains in the area, such as Attitash and Wild Cat. y are also a lot friendlier. Bretton Woods is the place to go if you want to wait in the longest lift lines ever, ski/ride very boring runs, and if you want to be treated like a second class citizen.

6363,2009-11-17,Idaho,Kelly Canyon,4,"I moved up to Idaho Falls Idaho the spring of 2006.  Having grown up in tropical South Florida I never really experienced much snow.  
My first winter turned out really well.  I took a trip to Jackson Hole and took my first snowboarding lesson.  After only 2 hours, I broke away from the class and took off on my own and by the end of the day had tackled 3 of their intermediate slopes.  From that first day I was hooked.  I think I caught on much quicker because I spent many years surfing and personally I think surfing is alot harder to master than snowboarding is.
For the rest of that winter and the following winter I frequented Kelly Canyon at least 4  6 times a month during ski season.  Often times more.  By the end of last ski season there wasn't a black diamond run I couldn't tackle.  (on Kelly Canyon that is)  Granted I'm 40 y/o and am not doing crazy jumps and whatnot, but I've definitely gotten it down to a science and snowboarding is now a passion of mine.  It's just like surfing in the aspect that, once you learn how and you've really connected with your board and your environment, there's no other rush like it in the world.  (well except maybe for bungie jumping or ski diving) but I digress.
Back to the mt.n itself.  Kelly Canyon is a great place to take the family.  It's more of a ""locals"" mountain than your larger s like Jackson Hole or Sun Valley.  But at the same time, you lack many of the ammenities that come with going to a larger , such as lodging, great restaraunts/bars, or misc entertainment.  This is a ""no frills"" locals only ski .  and while they do have a nice little lodge it is very limited and during busy times can get quite crowded.  y do have a couple of nice big fireplaces inside where you can get warm and grab a bite to eat.  y have a fairly decent snack bar that serves hot chocolate, cappuchino, coffee, a wide variety of soda, water and energy drinks.  Food wise they make some awesome french fries, chicken fingers and a decent cheeseburger (as long as you have them cook it well)  y get so busy at times they often dont cook the burgers all the way through, so make sure to have them cook it ""well"".  y also serve breakfast sandwhiches before noon as well as homemade brownies which are awesome.  
As far as the mountain is concerned, they've got 4 main lifts with 26 different runs.  About half of the mt.n is intermediate and 20% black diamond, 15% easy.  But as noted earlier, the black diamond runs aren't very tough, compared to say Jackson Hole or Grand Targhee.  For the most part you've got plenty of room to roam and you will really enjoy this mt.n. Also the runs aren't very long say compared to other larger ski s, but they all end where you can jump right back on the lift and head back up to do it all over again.   lines are usually pretty short as well.
y keep the four main runs groomed nicely and the rest of the mt.n is deep powder.  and that is one thing I love about Idaho/Wyoming area, the snow here is the lightest fluffiest snow i've ever experienced.  (although the Park City ski bums in Salt Lake will claim they have the best snow), but we know better.  :)
 It's only a short 30 minute drive from Idaho Falls and it's the least expensive place to ski/snowboard in Idaho.

6369,2009-11-19,Colorado,Silverton Mountain,4,"Skiing Silverton is like stepping into the backcountry, without the worries of impending avalanches, without having to purchase and read backcountry maps, and with the advantage of having an expert guide (like John) who seemed to know every place on the mountain to get fresh powder even weeks after the last major snowfall. This mountain does it right. Everything. Don't believe the reviewers who weren't happy with the 6000 feet of elevation in a day, they just have no clue what they are talking about. This is not skiing for skiing sake, or for bragging rights. This is getting back to what motivated people to ski in the first place. Big mountains, challenging lines, and pushing yourself more than you every have. This is what every mountain should be, and it is just fine with me that people are either too scared to ski it, or they would rather fight with the other skiers to get the best line possible at 830am and relax the rest of the day on the groomers.

6370,2009-11-19,New Mexico,Taos Ski Valley,5,"Taos is easily the best mountain in New Mexico and southern Colorado if you're looking for an old school mountain with steep back country terrain, s loads of powder and small crowds. On the most crowded day you're unlikely to run into more than ten people if you stay off the groomers. Kachina peak is great, but you're gonna hike for an hour, and it ain't flat.  peak is scenic, yes but if you're looking for challenging runs, you can get better ones without the walk.  Sir Arnold Lunn, Walkyries, Lorelei Trees are amazing runs right off  lift 7A, highline ridge, staufenberg, fabian and spitfire are worth the 15 minute hike. Despite the skiers posting neverending complaints about boarders, there isn't any tension, everybody does their thing and gets along fine. As far as nightlife, there isn't any, or anything else worth doing up there, just excellent, challenging terrain, without the lift lines and traffic of Colorado. ",Taos Rules

Today the temp. started below freezing but warmed up fast with showers by mid afternoon. Lots to do around the area when skiing gets too soft. Lots of resturants and outlet shopping.  lake is still frozen and that is fun to cross country ski or walk  to some of the Islands seen from shore. y say they will stay open until April, 5 but by then it is usually too warm in this area and the snow gets wet by then.

6402,2009-11-29,Massachusetts,Berkshire East,4," headline on thier trail map is ""Big Mountain Skiing."" For someone to suggest that there is any in the Berkshires is a bit much. OK, I'm nit picking here but, its pretty much in line with thier snow report. I forget exactly what the claim was for the day I went but, it far exceeded what I found upon arrival.  available terrain consisted of one green, one blue and, one black run from the top with a couple cut throughs here and there during Christmas week. We didn't have a great start in Southern New England this year but, with the exception of a couple hills in the wrong place at the wrong time that got demolished by ice, it wasn't impossible from a mountain management standpoint either. My home hill down in CT was 100% open by then and, I expected more open terrain at Berkshire East. I'm guessing in trying to get a feel for the place that it probably rivals Jiminy Peak for the best terrain in the area and will probably go back with knowledge of a solid snowpack to find out. I do like the meadow view of the Deerfield Valley, the river bottom not being too far from the base. However, the resulting low elevation does present the expected challenges.

Every year they eat up more valuable ski terrain and turn it over to snowboard single use/terrain park amusement park.  I was riding the lift with some women who have skied Copper for years also and they were talking about how Copper seems not to care about skiers at all anymore.  Where are the new lifts at Union Creek for beginners?  Where is the grooming?  Why are so many of their slopes icy and crowded with weird shaped moguls?  Where are the new runs?  Where is the glade skiing?  Areas like Beaver Creek, Vail, Snowmass, Aspen Highlands love skiers and are constantly doing what they can to keep skiers happy and coming back.

As a result there is powder everywhere. and along with MRG offers the best tree skiing in the East by far. and lots of expert terrain. Because Jay straddles the canadian border, it can be bitterly cold during mid winter and there really isn;t much night life to speak of, but after a day skiing powder, that doesn;t seem to be a problem.

6450,2009-12-06,Utah,Park City Mountain,5,"About 7 years ago a friend suggested that we take the family skiing.  Our usual vacation always had some sort of tripical drinks and bathing suits in it but after consideration we conceeded and booked it.  I still remember getting on the plane leaving 70% temps and hearing the pilot tell us current temps in the 20s... Yeiks!  However when we arived it was just beautiful, Snowing like crazy. Kids loved the snow and by the end of the 2 day after all of us had taken lessons and were making our way down the green runs togeather our entire family was hook line and sinker. ( daughter  3 yrs) My wife and I started to drive around and look at homes for sale.   After several trips back to park city and other ski s the following winters (breckenridge, big ski, keystone, ect) we still felt Park City was the best overall    Cute town, fun for the kids, just a great place to play in the winter.  2 years ago we found what we were looking for  a ski shalet within a block of the town lift, built in the 70s.  I have spent a couple of months renovating it and now its our dream ski home we have wanted.  Just carrie your skis or board out the door and your on the mountain.  With 13 ski s within an hour of park city I dont see us ever getting tired of terrain.  ",wolfman

Being close to Reno is both a pro and con depending how you party the night before.   drive is not far enough to work off the morning hangover.  Reno is a great place for a bachelor party if you are throwing one.

6483,2009-12-10,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"I always make a point to ski Breck in the early season. It's one of those classy s that's got a little bit of burliness to it so it's not just for the snooty somma time skiers. Opening day is always chaos, but Breck has some decent snow and a fast lift for opening weekend.

We skipped opening day this year and went the following day (November 13), after 3"" of fresh stuff fell on the man made. Everything was groomed well, so the white ribbon of death was plenty fun. Two runs were open, and the lift line was very well managed, so we only waited about 10 minutes for a chair. It kept dumping off and on throughout the day while we were skiing, which really added to the atmosphere. Nothing too exciting otherwise to report, as we only skied a few icy, man made runs.

 town of Breck is completely awesome for apres ski. When 4 O'clock is open, you can ski right into the town, or take the free shuttle. Two of my favorite places to eat and drink is Downstair at Eric's (get the Gigantor and you will not be disappointed) and Empire Burger (the Green Chile burger with jalapeno dipping sauce is next level). Both places have excellent staff and a great micro brew selection.

and, FYI, there's nothing cooler than being in downtown Breck while it's dumping. It will make you so stoked all over again to be in a ski town.",Justin Howell
6485,2009-12-10,Michigan,Pine Mountain,5,"Pine Mountain is a gentle slope, decently groomed but not a challenge on terrain (seeing an honest to goodness ski jump next to the slopes is too cool for words, it was the hilight of our last trip).  Terrain is great for beginners and those looking for room to practice technique, but its nothing that will have a solid intermdiate or advanced skiier licking their chops.  For those with beginners, the beginner area is small, cramped and looks like an afterthought rather than a planned part of the hill to help involve people new to the sport.   Food is average at best and guest service significantly below other hills in the area.  On more than one outing we seemed to be a distraction from the employee's job rather than the focal point of it.  Tickets are cheap (always a good feature) but here you really get what you pay for, which isn't nearly as much as this hill has the potential to provide.  and speaking of what you pay for, if you don't own your own boards RENT THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE.   last rentals we had in our party were old style straight skiis, clearly put into use on this hill before, what we would define as a modern ski, was on the market.   rental staff were more interested in carrying on their own conversation than doing a solid job of servicing the customer whose ski, boot and binding combinations are critical to having a good day.   combination of outdated equipment and a staff with no concern about the equipment really sets the tone on how this hill can ruin your day.   In short, Pine Mountain is now the absolute last destination for our group thanks to poor service and equipment.  ",nastarfan

6503,2009-12-11,Minnesota,Welch Village,4,"Welch Village, the little Twin Cities ski  That Can.  Every year at this time I make one pilgrimage down to Welch to ski.  For many people outside of the Twin Cities metro, it's not a destination ski .  and I can understand why.  But for me, it's a trip that I've been making with two friends from the area (who have since moved out West), so I continue the trek.

Too bad for Welch, they suffer from the same symptoms all Twin Cities ski s do: weather and lack of vertical.  Welch suffered poorly with the recent melt down in the last few weeks.   entire area is bare, save for the groomed runs.  Even then, some of the groomed runs have some exposed spots on them.  re's nothing that Welch can do about this; even the best grooming equipment in the world can't fix the lack of snow problem.

Another thing Welch can't control is their lack of vertical.  While there's plenty of terrain to ski  which is very impressive feat  there's not much length to it.  This is probably the big reason why people who are from the metro break away and head to Spirit Mountain or Lutsen, just to the north.

One thing Welch CAN control is their horrible, simply terrible lift system.  Never before have I seen such a ramshackle, piece meal set of junk in my life.  y are uncomfortable, seemingly dangerous, and filthy.  I cut my second day skiing short because I couldn't tolerate what a piece of junk they were somehow passing off to the customer as ""a lift.""  You'd be better off hiking up to the top...or just driving your car up some of the bare cat tracks.

 chairs on the Quad are nothing more than pieces of steel with two by fours on them for chairs.  While comfort isn't *that* big of a deal for me on a two minute lift ride, it just shows the lack of pride or ownership in your lifts.  On top of that, the lifts sway and lock in the leaned back or leaned forward position based on how they are jarred by the spotty gears.  at times you may be sitting upright in the chair on the Quad, only to be suddenly bucked forward  and locked forward  in the chair.   worst is when the lift stops and your jolted backward a bit and suspended like that...only to be shortly jarred forward some and locked in *that* position.  What a piece of crap.

Now this whole backward forward stuck thing on the Quad lift isn't because they don't grease their lifts.  Quite the opposite: they over grease their lifts.   permanent stain  about the size of an 8x11.5"" piece of standard paper  on the back of my GoreTex jacket begs to differ.   lifts leak grease onto the chairs so bad, it was ruining jackets at a high rate on Wednesday.  I saw at least 5 people with grease stains on their jackets walking around, and when I went into Mad Jaxx to use some dish soaps and a bar towel, the bartender said he had at least three people with the same grease stains on their jacket come in to clean them off.

Of course, I've spent the last day trying everything I can to get the giant grease stain out of my jacket, but nothing's working...I'm afraid it's their to stay.  I know most lifts drip grease, especially when it warms up and gets wet.  But what Welch's chair lifts do isn't ""drip grease"" as much as it ""completely smudge and ruin your jacket.""  Whatever the one word explanation is for that.

I'd post a picture of how massive and deep that grease stain is, but I'm still trying some stuff to get the stain out.  If I can, I will post the picture later (if it doesn't come out that is, *fingers crossed*) so you can see what you can expect from Welch's chair lifts (besides an uncomfortable, hairy ride).  If you go to Welch, make sure you wear either a black jacket (not a white one, like some poor lady did who got schmucked with grease!) or wear an old jacket.  Don't ruin your nice GoreTex jacket like I did.

I'll be writing a letter to Welch Village to tell them about the incident with my jacket.  I'm sure nothing will come of it, but at least there will be some documentation that someone has complained, so maybe in the future, some one else will be spared a stained jacket.  In the mean time, I probably won't be heading back to Welch since there's nothing there for me..just a stained jacket and the cow poo smell.",quinnman

6508,2009-12-11,Utah,Solitude Mountain,4,"  We (me, wife, 2 kids 8 and 10) visited Solitude in late March.  We had intended to go to Alta that day, but the Little Cottonwood Canyon road was closed for a few hours in the morning (we were staying in SLC), so we decided to try Solitude instead rather than waiting for the LCC road to open.  We are so glad we did!

  While booting up, we heard several other people mention that they also indended to go to Alta that day but came to Solitude instead because of the LCC road closure   a local said ""there is usually a bit more of a crowd when the LCC road is closed.""  Well...it this is ""more crowded"", I'd love to see it on a regular day.  It felt like we had the place to ourselves.  We skiied up and immediately sat down on every lift all day.

  Recent snowfall made the conditions perfect   deep powder on most runs   even the groomed runs had received 6 inches or so of snow since the grooming, just right for the kids.

  I liked the fact that the green runs and the easier blues that the kids skiied on were still steep/interesting enough that my wife and I could enjoy them too.  y had some long blue cruisers from the top that were perfect for the kids (Dynamite), but it also appeared that they had plenty of ""pedal to the metal"" terrain for more advanced skiing although I spent the day skiing with the kids.  I suppose it could be argued that Alta and/or Snowbird is a better place for the hardcore advanced skiier   and I guess I wouldn't try to argue against that   but Solitude has plenty of terrain for that type of skiier as well.

    has a bit of a smaller feel to it than Alta.   Even though the vertical is listed as 2000'+, there really aren't any single runs/lifts that take advantage of all of it.  If you do manage to ski top to bottom, it would take several lift rides to position yourself back at the summit to do it again.

   village looked nice.  We didn't spend any time there, but I think it would be a very nice place to stay.  It is much smaller than I had expected and doesn't have any of the ""mega "" feel.  Just a quaint, quiet collection of lodges/inns and a few restaurants.

  All in all, a great, quiet  with something for everyone.  Fantasic views.  No lines or crowds.  Convienent lodging if you can swing the $$ (although it doesn't look like it is any more expensive than any other slopeside lodging at other s).  I think the name ""Solitude"" is quite appropriate.

  I wish the lifts stayed open later tha 4:00   particularly after daylight savings time kicks in.  I suppose you could go over to Brighton (1 mile away) for night skiing if you really wanted to continue skiing.

  In fact, we are already trying to plan our ski trip next year and we are hoping to stay in the Village at Solitude   it would still be easy to venture to one of the other Cottonwood ski areas from there.  For a family, I think Solitude is a fantastic ""secret""...in fact...I shouldn't be telling you all of this...",wolfman

We hung out over here for the rest of the day and had a blast.  Glades were pretty thin, and like the rest of the mountain, flat.  This was fine though, there were plenty of different lines you could take through the glades, and a few little bumps to hop off.  Definitely a great place for a beginner to learn how to ski glades.

I have been to Grand Targhee twice within the past few years and overall it is a great mountain.  This place always rates high on snow quality and for good reason.  It was never crowded and its location seems to put in a place where it gets some major dumps.  Getting there is another story.  It is very out of the way, but the scenery is incredible.   view of the Grand Tetons from the top of the mountain is breathtaking.   only negative I can think if is that there seems to be no nightlife at the base village.  We only went there for the day, but it was very quiet.  Do not expect to come here and hit the bars and restaurants.   base village is very small and compact. You come here for the snow and that is Grand Targhee's greatest selling point.  It is also a very family friendly .  Everyone there was very friendly.  ",wolfman
6556,2009-12-17,Wyoming,Jackson Hole,4,"    I have been going to Jackson since I was 4 so I have been pretty spoiled. Jackson Hole is the premiere ski destination in America and one of the best in the world. I have been to other reosrts such as Lake Louise, Crested Butte, Timber Ridge, and Nubs Knob. None of which compare to Jackson Hole's scope.  mountain is covered head to toe with advanced and beginner runs making it a perfect place for any level of skier. If your a powder and tree lover then check out Moran Woods off the Casper Lift at about Mid Mountain. Its my favorite!
    Thanks to fresh snow coming in 3 or 4 times a week the runs won't become to cut up. Occasionaly an all out blizzard might hit the valley, which I found out about last year when avalanches closed most of the mountain for almost 2 days. That and snobby tourists are the only negatives in choosing to visit Jackson, but you will find the same things at any other great ski . 
    If your looking for beauty and a great meal then Jackson is also for you. Try driving north from Jackson and eating at Dornans in Moose.  food is great, but the view is better. You will be entertained by the second best view of the Grand Teton.  best view is from the top, haha.

Enjoy the best the west has to offer!

6557,2009-12-17,Wyoming,Snow King,3,"You cannot beat snow kings location, right in the middle of town. It is perfect for taking a break from work and getting in half a day of steep runs and an awesome view of Jackson Hole. Plus night skiing til 7 from Tuesday til Saturday. Overall the mounntain is small and steep unless you stick to the tiny bunny slope.  snow is never as good as it is out at the village( Jackson hole ) but the ticket prices compensate quite nicely.",wolfman
6559,2009-12-17,Wisconsin,Cascade Mountain,4,"Well, first off, this and devilshead make it a fun weekend, you can hit up both places and have more terrain to ski.  I had an incident where we went through an ""out of bounds"" and got our tickets clipped for the day...was a little disspointed we didn't even get a warning, we just followed people from earlier that day...But overall its a nice place for the midwest thats not terribly far from chicago.",wolfman
6560,2009-12-17,Illinois,Chestnut Mountain,4,"Chestnut Mountain is the best ski  I've come across in the Midwest, coming from Chicago.  re are activities for all members of the family   skiing/snowboarding, nightlife, dining, game room, swimming, sauna, jacuzzi, spa.  ir trails range from bunny to expert, a run for any skill level.  ""Far Side"" terrain park.  It's vertical drop is nearly twice as high as Wilmot.  Galena, the town it's situated in, offers more than Merrimac, Wis. (Devil's Head).  re is simply no better  in the midwest/chicago area.

 only down side is the couple of miles you travel on Blackjack Road. It can be pretty risky when snowing.",wolfman
6561,2009-12-17,Wisconsin,Devils Head,4,"I've been to Devilshead about 4 times now, we drive up from St. Louis.  It is pretty nice place and pretty large for a midwest .  First off you can't beat the midweek package, it's very cheap and the place is empty during the week.   terrain is pretty good, nice long runs and alot of natural terrain like wall rides and big rollers with a few tree runs.  My only real complaint with this place is the temperature.  Make sure you watch the weather when you go, when the temperature gets above 32 degrees the snow gets SLOWWWWWWW.  Some people complain about the lifts but after a while I got used to them, they are old but at least they are not slow like Cascade, those are the slowest lifts I've ever ridden in my 15 years of snowboarding.",wolfman
6562,2009-12-17,Iowa,Sundown Mountain,4,"Went here on a Monday.  Place was pretty much dead which was great.  No lines.  y had a nice snow pack and were also making snow from every spray head on the hill.  re were 2 groomers working the entire day, which kept the hill in great shape and really added to the experience.  Seemed well run and a nice place for where it is located.  Most of the runs were blue ish.  I would not want to tried to learn to ride/ski here.  re are just not any good green runs.  A good place to blast down the hill and get some exercise for the bigger s.  I would compare the runs to Afton Alps, but a bit longer and much fewer runs.  This isn't a large place by any means, but it is big enough for a few hours of fun.  Better than I expected, and pretty cheap.",wolfman
6571,2009-12-20,Utah,Snowbasin,5,"Some, like me, might consider the no rooms on the mountain a plus! Greatly updated since the Olympics, it has become our fave mountain, stealing our spoiled butts from Deer Valley most Days.  trick is to rent a room in Salt Lake and U can ski at any of nine mt.s. but Snowbasin is all alone so there are less lines, (many locals come here for that reason) and excellent skiing and amenities.  changing rooms and Johns are nicer and cleaner than at  Grand America Hotal (a 4 5 star Hotel in Salt Lake).  You can race down the same slope the used for the downhill races at the olympics and they have TWO Gondolas on opposite sides of the mountain so there is always more acerage to ski.  chairs are relatively fast and once you get past the initial morning rush, there are few, if any lines anywhere on the Mt.  food is like eating at a fine restaurant, always tasty, if sometimes pricey. But when you get a bowl of Beff Veggie stew, its more stew than broth, plus home baked bread to ckean the bowl. and if you dine up top, you get to watch "" Crazies"" who hike up to the chutes way up top and there's always either amazing skiing or amazing tumbles to watch and entertain you through the windows or out on the terrace if the weather is nice enough.
  y do a good job on the groomed areas, but there is plenty of off piste skiing for those more daring. My wife often signs up for a group lesson and is the only one or two in ""the group"". Instructors are top notch as they are at most Utah Mts. It's a very different feeling than park city or  Cottonwood Canyon s because there's no lodges, you feel more in tune with nature, and the views, because of that, are amazing.
      Although its almost alone, (Wolf Mt. is not too far but much smaller and ""home town""), the roads are always well plowed and easy to get to. About a 40 45 minute ride as opposed to a 35 40 minute ride to Alta or Deer Valley. If you like to be pampered, a la Deer Val. but like it quiter or not quiet so pampered, this is the place for you. You also meet locals in the Gondola on the way up that gladly point you to the best parts of the mountain and know the snow and weathered areas really well.
   worst thing thats ever happened to me is occasionally a fog will blanket the mountain and you cannot see a yard in front of you until it lifts, (usually in a half hour or so, if it comes) and is like being in a weird movie and interesting, scary fun in and of itself. Trails are decently marked and its always easy to find the bottom from anywhere. But as I said, great snow, great amenities, a few bucks cheaper, you just cannot go wrong here! We've skied here for 6 of the last 7 years and it gets better every year.",Dave Freeman
6577,2009-12-21,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,1,"This was the place I learned to ski and snowboard.  mountain is pretty big and there is all different types of runs. I like how there is a lodge at the bottom on the lake. re is great food and great when you get thirsty and don't want to wait to get back to the top. its also a great meeting place.  restaurants and bars are great, the last place we stayed was in the Rimfire lodge and it was really nice. the whole place was log, and the jacuzzi outside has great views. I would suggest you stay at Silver Creek if you are a boarder since that is where most of us are.

6582,2009-12-21,Colorado,Breckenridge,3,Young faimly's learning the ski or ride out west should go here to see what a big  really is about. Brek doesn't offer a lot other than good groomers. If you like groomers  you will love it!,wolfman
6583,2009-12-21,Colorado,Breckenridge,3,"Breck is one of the best mountains I've been to.  re are 4 peaks at the Breck ski area, peaks 7, 8, 9 and 10.  

Peak 7:
 Independence SuperChair accesses at least a dozen well maintained blue runs perfect for beginner/intermediate rides.  From the T bar or Imperial Expess SuperChair you can traverse over to the summit of peak 7 for some great expert terrain (Peak 7 bowl, Arts Bowl)

Peak 8:
From the peak 8 base area, which can get congested at times, you can access any type of run you would like from the beginner learning are to groomers of all abilities.   Vista Haus is a mid mountain on peak 8 and is a great place for an early or late lunch.  I always avoid eating/stopping in congested areas at lunch time.  From there you can either hit the T bar or 6 Chair lift above the treeline for some awesome black runs in Horseshoe Bowl or my favorite, the ""Back Bowl"" area to the left exiting 6 Chair.  From here you can also access the Imperial Express SuperChair which drops you off at an elevation of 12,840ft.  From here you can access many double black bowls and runs.  It's also a short 100 foot hike to the summit of Peak 8 at 12,998ft.  From here you can get to peak 7 summit, all the bowls off of peak 8 summit, and the extreme terrain of the Lake Chutes.  

Peak 9:
Peka 9 is filled with blue cruisers which can be annoying near the bottom with green trails cutting across toward the base of peak 9 and 10.  For the adventurous riders  Back 9 is a great place to find fresh powder and some extreme terrain.  It is hike in access only so you have to be smart and well preparred.   base area here has many amenities and is a great place to end the day.

Peak 10:
Peak 10 has one lift, the Falcon SuperChair which has access to some great advanced and advanced/intermediate runs.   trials on peak 10 are more gladed than most other areas in the  allowing you freedom to explore new lines and find the natural features.

Between these 4 peaks there is enough terrain for many years of fun and exploration.  Breck has done a good job adding lifts to keep the uphill capacity up, the lines down, and allowing you easy access to great terrain.",wolfman
6584,2009-12-21,Colorado,Keystone,3,"First off, we stayed at the same condo two years in a row, slope to keystone.  It had a lift on that side that ran all night, but this last year they stopped that lift which meant if we headed towards our unit, we were stuck and would have to shuttle it back to the gondola for night skiing!  This was really my only gripe. why close something like that! (and the food is expensive, but isn't expensvie at all the s!), Thats why it get four stars, and the nightife seems to be at breck!

I still haven't explored the whole mountain so it still seems fresh to me when we hit up the terrain!  lift ticket price is good for what you get, compared to vail's $100++ price!  This has been a long favorite of s for me.",wolfman
6585,2009-12-21,Illinois,Villa Olivia,2,"We just skied on February 21, 2009 which was Saturday during another snow storm for the Midwest. Lockers room and where you get your rental equipments are still in not so good of condition. Some lockers don't have keys on them anymore. But other than that, my friends were very happy and glad that I taught them how to ski at the bunny slopes. y have learned quickly and liked the tow ropes going up the hills.  ",wolfman
6593,2009-12-22,Washington,Mt. Baker,4,"Compared to Whistler and Mt. Hood, the two big vertical s of the upper northwest, Mt. Baker holds its own for it's snow, beautiful locale, friendly staff and inexpensive lift tickets.  Tucked away 30mi from the nearest town, gas up and cash up before you go, no ATMs at the mountain.  None of the lifts have safety bars... locals are friendly responsible people.  When the powder falls which is almost always... trails, not well marked, don't matter.  You just get off the lift and go.   most difficult terrain minus one double black chute, appropriately named  Chute, is not that difficult, so don't expect too much.  For most, there is enough variety to have fun for several days as my 11 yr. old son and I did over Thanksgiving... but then we crossed the expert only ropes all afternoon.  Great fun! ",R Lee Stump
6594,2009-12-22,Massachusetts,Jiminy Peak,4,Jiminy is a real nice mountain. I like the 1 double Black that they hve. It's fun and somewhat challenging.

I like the terrain park because it's always challenging. ,R Lee Stump
6595,2009-12-22,Michigan,Bittersweet,4,"Bittersweet Ski Resort is pretty nice for beginners. If you go to Cannonsburg it is a nice change from what they offer. y do not have as nice of a face as Cannonsburg. and the terrain park is slightly smaller. But they have more runs then what you find at Cannonsburg. Plus even beginners can take their express lift to the top if they are comfortable with it.

I didn't eat or look at dining options, but they appeared to have a ski shop, and a lodge.  lodge is nicer than Cannonsburg and I think for the Kalamazoo / Grand Rapids area this is better for beginners than Cannonsburg.

This hill is right by Timber Ridge and I would obviously go to Bittersweet before Timber Ridge.

Lift lines were small, but it was midweek during a dry spell of no fresh snow.

Just easy breezy groomers at Bittersweet....not much for people looking for advanced terrain in south west Michigan.",sewardhorner
6601,2009-12-25,California,June Mountain,5,"I love June Mountain.  It's a really nice .  Not too big, not too crowded   it's just right!  Good variety of slopes   everything from beginner to advanced.  It's got something for everyone.  and because it's close to the more popular Mammoth, it never gets too crowded.  y also have a great Student Season Pass that goes for something like $150.   crowd is pretty young   lots of college students.  and another bonus is that it has a beautiful view of June Lake and surroundings.

I would say the après ski is good but not extraordinary.  Check out  Tiger Café (or El Tigre as we liked to call it).  Some good places to stay are the Big Rock cabins, and we rented out cabins at the Interlaken condos   the hot tubs are great!  re are a bunch of hot springs in the area too, but it's best to scope them out in the daylight because some of them are tricky to find at night.

Overall this is a really fun mountain, with nice terrain and a great atmosphere!  A good alternative to Mammoth, and much more affordable.

6612,2009-12-27,Maine,Sugarloaf,4,"I went to Sugarloaf in March.  mountain is very big, second biggest in Maine.  lifts are fast and it is always groomed. re was also a great variety terrain, which made things nice. One problem is that most of the beginner terrain has lots of traffic, but most trails are wide enough to accommadate.  terrain parks are alsogood, there is an easy one, mid difficulty, and expert. re are two high speed lifts, although most of the others are slow. One thing I liked was that there were great views of other mountains, not urban sprawl, from the mountain. re is also an indoor skate park, rock climbing wall, weight gym and basketball court at the nearby anti gravity rec center. You can also visit the outdoor center and extenxive x c trail system. Several not so good things are that the food in the lodge is expensive, so bring your own lunch. If you are looking for a relaxing getaway, Sugarloaf isn't probably the best choice. re is a spa and some similar amenities, but they aren't as good as Sunday River. Sugarloaf is more for better skiing and boarding. You also can't count on the weather, when I was there, it was too windy for some lifts to be open, which was disapointing. But don't get me wrong, Sugarloaf is a great mountain if you want to ski or board, tons of glades, huge vertical drop and great snow. It is definitely a worthwile mountain for any skier or boarder.",DubbelSac
6614,2009-12-27,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,1,"I have been riding snowshoe mt.n for quite a many years. For the last 6 years I have gotten a season pass. This year after much thought I said no way to snowshoe. y have over priced tickets $75 dollars, they don't offer any fair package deals other than to the rich. True they have to make their money for making the snow, but everyone on this coast makes snow but only snowshoe charges these outrageous prices for their snow making when they only have 53% of the mt.n open. y try to take your tickets for riding under the lifts when there is snow on the ground. I have had more experience at this mt.n. than anywhere else. I have  also lived out west and snowshoe is so far behind with the pricing of tickets and lodging. This isn't Jackson Hole Wyoming so why the $75 dollar charge. Snowshoe isn't even the best  in the mid  atlantic. Just 49 miles north is Canaan Valley. y offer better terrain not as much but much better. ir tickets are a more reasonable price, less people attend so you don't have to fight crowds of non riders.  lifts are supposed to be high speed, well turn them up. Everything is situated on the top of the mt.n when it should be at the bottom. If all the condos and hotels were at the bottom there would not be a sewage issue, and more snow would stick around. Imagine if the top of snowshoe was clear, how much more good terrain there would be to ride with no where near as much melt off.  Snowshoe claims to be the best but by my own personal experience and I am a dedicated rider GO GET YOUR MONIES WORTH ELSEWHERE. Don't believe the snow report lies thats just a ploy to get people to the mt.n. I remember calling plenty of times for a snow report and finding out that it was a big lie when I arrived. During the past seasons I was riding Snowshoe every week three times a week  I have seen the best days that mt.n has to offer, I have also seen the worst and for the most part this is what you get. Recommended s are Seven Springs Penn, Canaan Valley WVA, Boone Nc, Whisp, Hidden Valley. When it comes to snowshoe don;t believe the hype    ",ryan dunlap
6620,2009-12-28,Vermont,Okemo Mountain,4,"Okemo is first and foremost a really fun place to ski. When we were there (just before Christmas 2009) there were no lines and essentially uniform conditions on every slope    groomed New England hardpack, with little or no ice.  gradations of difficulty between green circles and black diamonds is razor thin    there's barely any difference between them! I would imagine the only characteristic that really distinguishes the trails is how they're groomed. Every single trail we skied, from green to double black, had a nice, gentle pitch, twists and turns, and was basically a cruiser. (Note: the gladed stuff was all closed when we were there; maybe that invalidates some of what I just wrote.)

Even though Okemo is a pretty sprawling place, with several sub areas shoulder to shoulder, it's beautifully laid out. You never have to ski uphill or even skate on flats. We skied downhill 100% of the day despite going to and fro between the main area and Jackson Gore several times.

re are lots of long almost top to bottom cruisers here that are just a pleasure to ski. You can turn wherever and whenever you want because there's nothing in the way, ever. re's enough pitch to get you going but not enough to be challenging. Just lay your boards down and let 'er rip.

Having skied Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, in terms of challenge, Okemo is not even on the map. It's from a different universe    one in the shape of a blue square. But man is it fun. It was so cold my nostrils froze, but I was grinning from ear to ear. Okemo is awesome.",R Lee Stump
6621,2009-12-28,New Hampshire,Mt. Sunapee,4,"I like Mt. Sunapee as it is the closest ""big"" mountain to Boston.  Not enough chair lifts so it tends to get intensely crowded though the singles line move quickly.   terrain is incredibly easy  the blacks are really not difficult at all.  I would consider it to be a ""blue"" mountain with nice flat terrain.  ",R Lee Stump
6629,2009-12-29,Virginia,Bryce,5,"OK so I just went there for the first time and...the liofts are a joke and need to be replaced. y have a rediculous ramp that 50% of the boarders could not successfully board off of the lift. I have had 10 years of board'n and that lift on the right streesess me out. Like beginner and intermediate slopes on the mt.n but you need to be a pro to get off the lift. y call them double's but they barely fir 1 large guy and then to try to dismount w/ 2 up there?  That's a tough one. 

 trails were short as the mt.n is small.  Go during the week if at all.  I WILL NOT GO BACK.  Plenty of other better options around dc! Great for beginners w/ bunny slopes galore. Slow lifts.

Grooming is the worst I have ever seen. Afternoon is better as skiers and boarders self groom that chunk of hard snow/ice.",ryan dunlap
6630,2009-12-29,West Virginia,Winterplace Ski,1,skiing was great. thurs and fri had no lines and saturday lines were small. snow slowed up slopes which forced you to have to pole around to get some of the lifts but that was only problem.  good trip!,ryan dunlap

6636,2009-12-30,New Hampshire,Crotched Mountain,5,"An absolutely brilliant find! This place was the best fun we have had yet!!

When I saw their website I got the impression that they were a snowboarding grunge outfit, and was completely put off.
However, as it is so close to other good places we thought we would give it a try; the web site does them a HUGE disservice! It is a family run, family orientated ski !
I have skied for 35 years and learnt to ski in the Alps, have skied all over Europe and we've tried out loads of s in NH, VT and ME and this is honestly the most PERFECT place for learner skiers wanting to transition from greens to blues and blacks, jumps and fore line skiing.
All the blacks are very short, so you can see where they join the easier trails, so really fun to try, but not frightening.
 blues are all wide and criss cross the greens, so you can take it bit by bit, and really let go if you want to.
re are large areas of woodland trails with little bumps, and we had great fun ""bunny hopping"" through the trees with all the other kiddies.
re is a HUGE snowboarding park, with a seperate lift, so snow boarders go one way and skiers another, but you can drop onto bits of it to try a jump if you want.
ALso, there is also a lovely mogul run, which is crossed by a green and a blue, so again something to try out, but you can drop off it gets too much
 views at the top are amazing; you can see right across to Sunapee and beyond, and the greens are lovely and long, wide and run right along the ridges, so views all the way down.
We did night skiing for the first time (and my 5 year boy was SO excited!) a timed slalom, and the lodge is really clean and tidy, with a good restaurant.
 only tricky bit is that the ""green"" chair lift is a 2 man which is tough if you have more than 1 to 1 ratio of kids to adults, and you don't want to pass your kids over to strangers. But it is slow enough for older or competent children to use, and the attendants are very helpful.
 
All the skiers seemd to be locals with families and everyone was really relaxed and considerate.
No aggresive speeding...and NO lines at the lifts, we skied straight on!
My children have gained such confidence and are thrilled to have done their ""first black""!
 
Car parking is spread out across the base, so easy to get to and from cars. 

Do NOT go to Crotched mountain if you like your children to DDblacks backwards with a hat over their eyes; as apart from the terrain park, there is NOTHING on this mountain for the adrenalin junky!
Maybe that is why I had the most fun seeing my children really relax, enjoy themselves and get the confidence to try out all the new things, and I didn't have to worry about a thing.
However, Pats Peak and Granite Gorge are 10 mins away, and Sunapee is 20 mins away, so for a long w/e it is a great place to go to for one day, and then if bored, try somewhere else down the road the next day, or split the party.
 
We were told that after 13 years of hard times the current owners relaunched it 3 years ago. 
 north side is open, and when they get more money they will open the south side (which you can get to with a short walk, but ungroomed/ powder skiing). 
So I just thought I would do my bit to support them as it really was the most fun time we have had yet and they deserve to do well! 
Such a well thought out set of trails. A brilliant w/e and I am still on a high!
We are going back next week.

6638,2009-12-30,Michigan,Bittersweet,3,Ratings are based on Southwest MI.     snow has been fine for being mostly man made and well groomed.  All trails open when we went.   lift rates for kids are too high.  Most s have a discount for kids 10 and under.  Paying full price for a 7 year old is pretty hard to shell out which limit our trips to Bittersweet even though it is our favorite place in SW MI.  Timberridge and Swiss Valley make it more affordable for a family with young kids.   ,tandmkirk

6664,2010-01-02,Michigan,Big Powderhorn Mountain,5,"Big Powderhorn was always run efficiently by ski hill professions, but the new owners bring even more.  new owners actually ski. This is a big deal since not only do they bring many years of ski professionalism to the hill, but they understand what skiiers and boarders want. re are new terrain parks, improves runs, and a host of activities and events to keep the day busy. Oh, they also installed lights. Now you can arrive Friday night and get some skiing in.
 new owners have also worked out package deals with the separate lodging organization. Separate, but now the whole Bavarian style village valley area is functioning like one .
I like it there because the family can downhill ski, cross country ski, snowboard, skate, snowmobile, take a walk to the nearby waterfalls (7 total) of just sit by the fire and read a book.
 new owners installed wifi in the ski lodge so you can stay connected with the office while you watch the kids show off on their snowboards. This helps me extend my time up there.
re is a free shuttle bus to take you to area restaurants and bars. y will pick you up at your rented chalet. Care free way to enjoy the evening out with friends.

6676,2010-01-03,Indiana,Paoli Peaks,4,"I've been skiing at Paoli Peaks for almost 20 years, now.  y do absolutely the best job of making snow and then taking care of it of any place I've skiied.  Seriously, they do and it's because they have to.  I almost always have a great time when I'm there and that's primarily because I know what I'm getting when I go.  If they are nothing else at Paoli they are consistent.
Is it a world class ski ?  Not by any stretch.  Do they have snow on a slope?  Absolutely!
 lodge is comfortable, the food is average and the value for your dollar is acceptable.  If you are looking for a true destination type ski experience you will come away disappointed.  If you are a beginner looking for a place to get  your first experience on skis or an experienced skier looking for a place to get some runs in between trips to ""real"" s you will probably be very satisfied.
 only real caveats are that it can get crowded on the weekends.  If you pull into the parking lot and see more than one church bus plan on spending your day skiing defensively since there will be plenty of out of control beginners pumped up on peer pressure trying to ski runs that are beyond their ability.
Graber's Express is listed as a black diamond run but it's barely a blue at most s.   runs are short and the 300 foot vertical they boast may be a bit of a stretch.  Still, Paoli is a fun, friendly, comfortable little ski area. Keep in mind that it IS, after all, in Southern Indiana.  y are doing absolutely the best they can with what they have.",MCPG

6680,2010-01-03,Tennessee,Ober Gatlinburg Ski,2,"I brought my family and friends (4 adults and 3 kids) to ski on Dec 27 though the 30th.  I was amazed at the long line of cars trying to enter the amusement park.  I say amusement park because that is what Ober is.  Ober is not set up to handle the 3000 plus daily visitors it received, but with patience, and some good advice, you can manage not to get mauled by the many inexperinced skiers that routinely crash into each other. 

First, if you want to bring your family for an awesome tubing time, make sure that you are waiting at the gate no later than 7:30am.   main gate opens at 8:00am, pay your $5 for parking, and head directly to the top of the hill.  Once there, immediatley exit your vehicle, go into the front door and head to the back left of the building and get in line.  Select the 1:00pm session (read below for further explanation). If you do not follow this advice, you will be number 300 in line by 8:15am and miss out on the tubing.  By the way, make sure that your whole tubing party is with you or they will not be able to get a braclet and you woke up early for nothing. 

Second, if you want to do some family sking or serious sking, do not go during the morning session.  You can't walk  around the general area or ski without someone running into you.  re is simply not enough room.  Select the 3:00pm to 10:00pm session and take your time.   slopes will not clear up unitl 5:00pm.  After 5:00pm, you finally have enough room to teach your kids how to ski without having to dodge the many, many, many out of control skiers.  After 7:00pm, send the kids to bed, and ski to Ober Chute as many times as you can.  It is one of the only 4400' runs that you can find in the south and it is the only reason worth going to Ober.

Third, if you want to take group lessons, bring a snack and folding chair while you wait in line.  Pay the $60 for a private lesson.  Ask for T.J.

Last, I suggest staying in a chalet as close to the park as possible.  If not, make sure that you have plenty of gas to wait in line in your car.

Would I go back to Ober again? If they would restrict the number of visitiors each day, then yes.

#3 SNOWBOARDERS   re are ramps on the mountain and the snowboarders CAMP OUT ON THE MOUNTAIN by the ramps to do their twists and jumps. When you're coming down the black diamond section it is not easy especially for a person in skis to make a dead stop or a sharp turn unlike snowboarders. Plus there are those snowboarders that have fallen after their jumps that are everywhere on the mountain. It is no fun trying to just avoid them all the time. I had to make so many stops and fell down many times also twisted my knee, just trying to avoid people. It seems Appalachian or the ski patrols don't do anything about this situation.  main slopes should not be used by people to camp out and has to be as clear as possible.",Nathan Dively
6703,2010-01-05,North Carolina,Ski Beech Mountain,4,"Arrived 12/31/09 and hit the slopes New Years day for the afternoon session. Snow making at full blast, low visibility. It had rained the day before, so ice was to be expected. Given the icey conditions and non stop, aggressively loud snow blowing , the experience was mediocre at best. We hoped for a better day on January 2. Waking up to 4 inches of powdery snow, we were optimistic, if not downright excited. Arriving at the mountain to hear the snow blowers running at full blast was a bit disheartening. Visibility was nill, making conditions treacherous. To make matters worse, most of the slopes were sheets of ice. It was still snowing steadily powdery snow, and with 4+ inches from the previous night, the increased icey sheets all over the mountain made no sense. It was as if they had not groomed the mountain at all the night before.

 customer service in the cafeteria, the ticket kiosk, and the administration offices, where I requested that they relent on the snow making as a last  to salvaging the ski trip, were all the model of inefficiency.

I can say with confidence that I will never return to Beech mountain short of new management, stellar ongoing and consistent reviews, and overall word of drastic changes in conditions and customer service. ",Nathan Dively

It took about 30 minutes to get out on the slopes.  I tried to upgrade my pass to a two day pass at about 4:15 PM but the ticket line was closed (early). I asked the manager about upgrading the pass and he said the ticket line closes at 4:30 and I would have to wait until 6 PM to upgrade my passes.  He did not offer any help when I pointed out that it was not yet 4:30 and that the ticket window had closed early.  He did suggest arriving by 9 AM the following day to ""beat the crowd"".

Tuesday, 12/29/2009, we arrived at 9 AM to find a long line of frustrated people waiting at the single open lift ticket line.  re are three ticket windows that could be utilized for the holiday rush period but are not used.  I had my wife wait in the open line and I went to the cash only line in case it were to open.  I asked several staff about when the cash line would open and no one had any idea.   cash line finally opened an hour later.  I could have driven a little further to Boone and skiied at a bigger  in the time I had to wait in line to get tickets and skis!

 slopes were fair but poorly managed. Ski patrol were there on Tuesday but I did not see any on Monday.    lift lines entry points were treacherous for beginners and the loading points were too low.  Fortunately, I am an advanced skier but I felt sorry for others who were just learning to ski.
 
 lodge is rudimentry at best.  re is not a place to hang coats so they get piled on tables.  Consequently, a child accidentally spilled a coke on two of our ski jackets.   food is mediiocre.

 staff is poorly trained and just there.  No one knows anything you ask.   whole operation is poorly organized.  Don't bother buying lift tickets online either.  You still have to wait in the ticket line with everyone else to pick up your ticket.  I talked to some locals who have season passes and their own equipment.  y do not have to wait in lines, except for lifts and food.  Something to keep in mind if you live close enough to take advantage of the pass.

To their credit the owners have installed a lot of state of the art snowmaking which helps, but it doesn't cover what many advanced skiers/boarders would like as the best terrain: the bowls and most advanced runs, and there's no off piste, hike to areas for the adventurous. This is not the place for powder seekers. It's a nice sized  that otherwise will satisfy intermediates on the groomers that have snowmaking.  town of Ketchum/Sun Valley is delightful and really feels ""western"", with some fake stuff thrown in, but is much more interesting than purpose built s like Vail and Beaver Creek   but those places get more snow. Before you contemplate going here check the conditions, if it's good by all means visit Sun Valley, at least once, it's got a nice sense of history and you'll almost have it all to yourselves.",papi6022

Although the  claims to have about 34 ski slopes, there are only about 5 or 6 major trails that are open with any frequency. About half of the 34 trails do NOT have snowmaking and were created about 10 years ago.  ski area refers to these trails as ""Glades"" where one is to (supposedly) ski though areas where the trees have been thinned out. I have found the aforementioned ""Gladed"" ski slopes to be covered with rocks, stumps, brush and saplings. Moreover, the Glades seem to have become even less skiable over the years due to an increase in the level of undergrowth and brush. I might add that Blue Knob receives an average of about 100 inches of natural snow per year, which is far less than the snowfall required for quality tree skiing without any snowmaking. 

As for the conventional ski slopes at Blue Knob with snowmaking, I have found them to be icy (more times than not) with substandard grooming. Additionally the chairlifts are old and SLOW. and the terrain park (if you can call it that), is small and limited.  tubing park is FLAT and SLOW without much tube speed or thrill for the average adult rider.

We were skeptical about our trip up but it turned out to be pretty decent especially when you consider the drive. We cut our drive an hour short from when we usually drive up to Killington. 

 North Face ended up being pretty decent but the lift operations at the  really turned what could have been a great day into a so so day. On our first day there, Challenger didn't open until 12 so only Outpost was running which caused a severe backing up of people with operators that weren't doing a very good job. at 2PM the lift operators shut down Outpost so only Challenger was running creating a similar sardine packed line. This all happened even though the lift signs clearly state that the lifts close at 4PM. 

Once up top, the game changes.  North Face provides a really good variety of different types of terrain from quick flat steep trails to lots of bumps.  glades were fun and views are really beautiful

This is why this  is a top Ski  in my book: definately family friendly, friendly staff, probably the 3 or 4 biggest terrain park in cali, lots of steep advanced runs, amazing ski school and beginner hills (unlike Squaw and many other places), perfect intermediate runs all over the , also nearly 1700 vertical feet. at Sierra Summit the ticket prices are very cheap and you are given access to 7 chairs, 1 T bar, 2 haddle tows, 1 magic carpet, almost 50 spreaded out runs, more unknown runs, and 100s of acres of trees.  best part about Sierra Summit is that the groomed runs stay groomed, there are undeveloped riddges, and powder that lasts more than a couple hours like Mammoth, Squaw, and any other tahoe . 

 location of Sierra is breath taking.  top of Sierra Summit looks out to Huntington Lake. This lake is the 3 best sailing lake in America. On the other side of Huntington Lake there is Lakeshore Resort! re is amazing food, a general store, a crazy bar, weekly dances, and a lot of history. ",djgray
6827,2010-01-18,New Hampshire,Ragged Mountain,1,"In the previous week the mountain had gotten over a foot of snow so the ground conditions were excellent and there was still some leftover powder that you could find.  I had a blast riding that day.

Only con that I have is there is essentially one good lift, the high speed 6 seater.  If you are an intermediate or higher rider you only have a choice of the high speed or the triple chair which is painfully slow, probably 3 times as slow.  re are a couple minor and surface lifts but essentially if you wanted to spend your time well you only had one option.   re was a good number of people there and a few to 5 min wait for the high speed which isn't too bad, but at one point in the afternoon there was some mechanical trouble with the lift and it stopped for about 20 min, by the time it got resolved the wait was very long. If the high speed was to breakdown, the triple chair can not handle the number of people who were there.  y should put in another high speed in place of the triple or make it faster, because it was slower than most other chairs that I've been on.

Overall really fun experience.  I would recommend it for friends to go.",eewdad

Later in evening, wind died down and had access to whole mountain.  One lift was not running which kept us (family) on one side for part of the night.  Overall, a very pleasant evening.  One drawback were the snowboarders.  Many were going too fast through slow areas.  y were also littered throughout the trails sitting and talking, some in the middle of the trail, some to the side.  Very difficult to see them sitting because of night skiing and many were dressed in dark colors sitting or laying in a shadow area.

It was a bitter chill the first day we skied, and even those conditions were better than what you get in some other s on a good day. Some icy patches were there but for the most part it was powder and lots of it.  glades were what we came for and Jay Peak provided. We skied the glades and bumps almost exclusively our entire trip there.

Reviews that judge a place based on the weather/snow conditions should be taken with a grain of salt (or relegated to the ""pointless"") category. 

its all relative when it rains/ices over at smuggs, you're gonna find those conditions pretty much everywhere in the region.  Transversely, Smuggs, Stowe, and the others in Northern VT  WILL often have considerably better conditions than neighbors to the south, east, or west.  local weather phenomena, occuring with regularity year in and year out.  

Smuggs has slow lifts  keeps the crowds regulated on the hill.  If you like fast lifts, go to Killington or Stowe and pay for 'em.  If you like amazing treeskiing (especially if you know where the stashes are) go to smuggs.  Smuggs generally gets the second most snow in VT (along with Stowe) behind Jay (really, Jay's snow is only marginally better), but the terrain is waay more interesting and challenging at Smuggs than Jay.  

Place has got the vibe, more crowded on weekends (nothing like killington or stowe, though).  It's a pretty big locals spot  has cool vibe like MRG, great terrain (like MRG, Sugarbush, and Stowe), and isnt' that much $.   Overall, a great compromise and My #1 spot in VT.",Ontheslopes

(upper was closed for snow making, as was Ripsaw),  first 2 runs Weds. were nice, then it got a bit scraped down. I'm a big packed power fan, as I do not use competition skis. 

On TH, the first 5 runs down lower Flume were nice, then it was a bit granular/scraped down from traffic. Tons of bumps on Triple Trouble. Angel Street was nice on top on Weds, but scraped down to grass lower. y made a ton of snow up top & I'm sure the w/e was good there. Mikes Woods glade was closed.

 superpipe is fun to do   overall, Loon os a great hill for almost anyone. 

I skied all over the mountain and Loon has some beautiful scenery. I couldn't see Mt Washington because of the clouds both days, but still got some great pics.  top of Loon Peak & North Peak were totally white with snow.

6854,2010-01-20,Wyoming,Jackson Hole,4,"after my winter of '72 at jackson, i admit to being spoiled by no tram lines and endless days of powder and steeps.  on jan 6 09 i tried again.  the hotels in jackson are still cheap because the winter traffic is less than the summer, and they all need your business, so it's 1/3 the cost of aspen, for instance.   unfortunately, in my opinion, they have made a mess of the base area, with buildings blocking runs so if you make a wrong turn you have to climb back up to the lifts.  you pay $12 for parking close enough to walk, or $5 for shuttle distance parking.  what was once the ample parking lot is all divided into corrals and gas stations, and wasted space not being used at all.  the $91 lift ticket includes the tram if you don't mind waiting a long time.

there was 10"" of new, which generated a HUGE crowd at the base before 9 a.m.  then an avalanche caught a patroller doing control work, swept him over a cliff (his status is still critical and i hope he makes it).  they didn't open the gondola for hours, and the huge crowd was stuck on apres vous, an intermediate hill to the right of the mountain.  they never opened the real mountain, no tram, no thunder, finally the gondola opened and the powder was GONE within one run.  there were 2 groomed runs to the bottom where there was not enough snow to get off, so it was a freeway full of sliders.

my advice, don't go to jackson with less than about 70"" base.   jackson is a ROCKY and steep mountain and needs a lot of snow.  all of the outer bowls,  hobacks, and faces below thunder were closed, so we were basically confined with the crowd onto two lifts and 1/4 the mountain.  the other advice is to avoid christmas and spring breaks because the housing capacity exceeds that of the mountain now and you don't want to be there when all those condos are full and everyone comes out at opening bell.

You can't leave anything not locked in a locker, because it would be stolen the second you walked away.  Lockers cost $1 each time you open it, so if you need to get stuff throughout the day, say good by to your dollar bills.  When I went to get my rentals, the guy who ""helped"" me could not figure out how to size the standard ski binding to my boot, needed help to size it, and he didn't even know what size ski to give me.  Looking at the west  trail map, my friend and I decided to try out one of the black diamond runs on the mountain.  Unbelievable!! y're ""advanced' runs would barely be considered intermediate at any other mountain.   ""snow"" is just a bunch of fake snow with a layer of extremely hard ice underneath.  snow melts during the 45 degree days and then freezes solid at night.  Very oriented towards snowboarding.  If you are a snowboarder, and just want terrain parks, then this is the place for you.

People were zipping by in the ""slow area"" and wouldn't let me practice my big turns! (LIke I said   I was a beginner). After 45 mins I tried to get my money back and they wouldn't let me eventhough they weren't enforcing their slowzone rules.  I was not a happy camper!

Ever since then we've always gone to Killington and now I mostly ski the blues.  We wanted to do a quick day ski trip so we were looking at going either here or Mohawk.  After reading all of the reviews to here, I decided I'd give it one more shot.

IT WAS AWESOME!  snow was groomed so well, the people were so helpful, the trails were for all levels, it wasn't over crowed (we skied Sunday morning) .... it was just a great overall experience.  We think this will always be our local ski  and we are planning our next trip already!",Brian Lewis

But soon got bored.  Moved onto Run 7 (Dom's Way), which had two steep inclines, both times I took my skis off and walked it.  Feeling stupid, I looked and found the lady next to me doing the same thing.  It would be nice to have something in between or I need to take another lesson.  Food was overpriced and not appetizing.

6868,2010-01-21,Massachusetts,Otis Ridge,5,"This is one of the ones I had always driven past. I'm glad I stopped here one night and paid the usual asking price of $12.00 for a night ticket. This was mid January and, not too long after the hill took a real beating from an ice storm. I skied in the dark and had a great time doing it. Every time I saw a coil of wire nailed to a tree, I reminded myself that this is not a deep pocketed , they were doing what they could to put the place back together and, that someday, that coil of wire would run a string of lights again. With one double chair, a couple surface lifts and, 300 vertical feet, Otis Ridge is not for those with short attention spans. Although, for its size, it skis pretty well. What they do have is the easy access, affordability, and community feel that got us all into skiing at our own home hills in the first place. Its isn't glitzy and, for what it is, it shouldn't be. If you don't mind sitting under a couple slightly brownish tiles in the drop ceiling at  Grouse House, you too might be able to chat with the groomer about his grouchy old Piston Bulley while eating stuffed clams from the toaster oven. If that's a bit too humble for you please pack the brats and the blonde in the Bogner in your BMW and go to Windham. Otherwise, you and your family should have a great time.

As far as the snow went, this was awesome (how can you complain about run after run of knee deep fluffy white powder). However Beaver Creek is definitely not the place to go for your first time or if you are on a budget. To start with the parking at the base of the mountain is the steepest that I have experienced (it was $33 a day when we went), although you can park in a number of free parking areas and catch the free shuttles to the  or to some of the lifts that give access to the mountain.  on mountain food seemed to be the same as all of the on mountain food for all of the Vail owned s, however, the price here was higher for the same food.  mountain village is definitely beautiful and the heated pavements and the moving walkways definitely add to the exclusive feel of the .",runner/skier

On the intermediate trails, there were people trying to teach their 7 year olds to ski, the snow cover was non exsistant on many trails, with large patches of ice.  line for a lift ticket was 30 45 minutes long, a 15 minute wait to get into the cafeteria, with no place to sit. We got there at 10:30 but were not able to get onto the slopes for 2 HOURS due to lines everywhere, including the rest room. While waiting in line for the lift, somebody slipped at the landing and the operator didn't bother to stop the lift but slowed it down instead so the person was knocked down by the lift. In the bar, don't expect food because nobody will wait on you. Also, expect to spend most of your time trying to avoid little kids that are too inexperienced to be on the blue and black trails with their parents yelling at them to ""stop crying, its not that steep"". 
Oh yeah, half the mountain closes at 4:30, so its a complete rip off because you have to wait a half hour for the lift each time. I guess a lot of people found out about Elk Mountain so it is very crowded now and not worth your time. ",ryanscottmac

When I got to the  and checked in after driving three hours from NC, I was extremely disappointed to find out that the lifts were closed and that we were going to pay for a two night stay at a ski  with no skiing. 

Fortunately, the front desk staff were extremely friendly and competent. All of the staff at the Wintergreen  were very accommodating and assured me that things would be taken care of in the morning.

I was very impressed by the accommodations.  room was spacious, well decorated,  and nicely updated in all aspects from the two flat screen TVs and the plush carpeting. In addition, the Mountain Inn is a stone throw away from the slopes.  workout center is top notch, dining is well done and affordable, and the staff are genuine and personal.

6931,2010-01-27,New York,Catamount Ski Ride Area,4,"Catamount is a really nice small full sized ski station, with surprisingly long runs through really pretty glades and is a great challenge to your technique.
Brilliant for good intermediates and below, it is very close to the beautiful and cultured towns of Great Barrington and Stockbridge and if you were planning to stay for a while, there’s plenty of variety in skiing if you include a visit or two to Catamount with visits to a couple of other very nearby skiing areas (Butternut and Mohawk, maybe).
 mid week deals are amazing for anybody up to high intermediate, $84 for lift ticket/rentals and lesson, which may turn out to be private with great instructors. Instructors discussing the economy and international trade – as I said, it’s a cultured area. and very friendly lodge and booking staff.
A few other reviewers have complained about the ice/hard snow and the limited skiing. Well, if you are an expert, that’s probably true of everywhere except the big mountain s a few hours north.
 snow in New England does seem to be icier than elsewhere, but with an instructor, is an amazing way to improve your technique – I was amazed at how many skiers where really good technically.

Personally, I hate the fact that they don't give honest stats on their snow report and inflate their trail count.  On Christmas Day with advertised 26 45"" base, they still had 30 trails closed and ""thin cover"" posted on a number of the open trails.  Doesn't bare dirt and thin cover on open trails mean 0"" not 26""?  As for trails, like the Hutch/Merritt/Wilbur Cross Parkway in CT... one road that changes names three times, at Okemo one trail may have four names top to bottom... and some may only be 10 20 yards cross connecting... just to hype to trail count... like Sprout... it's laughable.

On a more positive note, they do make snow, lot's of it, and keep it pretty well groomed.  You can find enough variety of terrain to keep you busy for a day and if you're lucky, with natural snow their glades are pretty good.   staff are friendly, their instructors are top notch and you can get good food at the base, mid mountain and the summit.

6946,2010-01-28,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,4,"I normally do not post reviews of anything, but I wanted to respond to the two misleading reviews prior to this one, as that author is obviously in attack mode. 

We have been coming to Snowshoe for a decade now, and we continue to be highly satisfied.  We were there for three days over the New Years holiday, and skiied from opening time (first tracks all three days!) to closing with only one short break each day. 

   Conditions were perfect, except for high winds on Saturday.   grooming staff at Snowshoe is as good as any in the business, and having some extra powder overnight was an added plus.  While we were there, only one trail was closed on Thursday, and 100% open Friday and Saturday.

   Even though the  was at full capacity, the longest lift line we stood in was less than 10 minutes at the Ballhooter quad, and then only a couple of times.  at some of the smaller lifts, we consistently skiied straight to the loading area.

   Snowshoe has the most, and most varied, terrain of any east coast ski  south of New England.  You may find lower lift ticket prices at other mid atlantic locations, but you'll save 25% for 50% less skiing.

   Service at all levels continues to be top notch, with the exception of Starbucks.  In fact, the friendly staff is one of the things my wife and I consistently note as a high point for each trip.

   Skiing in closed territory gets you kicked out of every ski  in North America.  If it's closed, stay out   even if there's snow there.  re is a reason they don't want you skiing in certain areas, and don't whine when you get caught breaking the rules and endangering yourself.

   Snowshoe is NOT a place for a one day trip, unless you already live within an hour or two of the .   remoteness can be a challenge for anyone who is afraid of driving in snow, but it also adds to its charm.  If money is an issue, bring your own food (we eat all but one meal in our condo each year), but as others have noted the nearest true grocery store is an hour or so away so plan accordingly.

If you can afford airfare to Colorado or Utah, by all means go there   we've skiied there, and you can't beat the big mountains.  If money is not an issue at all, go to Europe   we've skiied the Alps, too, and the atmosphere is completely different than at U.S. s.

6950,2010-01-29,Arizona,Arizona Snowbowl,3,"I Finally got to actually ski at Snowbowl after previously driving there twice only to find out that they were not operating on both of those days due to what would be classified as moderate winds.  re were two reasons that i went back: curiosity of what there actually is at the , and because i had a free lift ticket.    best way that i can sum up the overall experience is ""boring.""   lifts are extremely slow, and if you want to ski any terain that could be classified as intermediate to advanced you have to take the long Agassiz lift.  Even on a Wednesday i had to wait at least 5 minutes to get on the lift, sometimes in teh 8 10 minute range.  Once on, it definitely takes 15 20 minutes to ride up, and then you can ski down rather quickly in 3 5 minutes, depending on your trail.  So, if you add it all up, you get to do about 2 top to bottom runs per hour......and this is on a weekday.  I can only imagine what a weekend is like.  re are other shorter lifts at the , but they service beginner terrian.   My visit was 5 days after they recieved 60 90 inches of snow from a major storm, and there was a lot of iced over patches on the mountain due to the positioning of the  in relation to the winter sun.  I was expecting much better packed powder than there actually was.    terrain park was OK, as i have seen much better and much worse, and anyone who claims that there is nightlife at the  is lying.  re is absolutely no nightlife around the , the closest ""nightlife"" would be in the city of Flagstaff and its easily a 25 minute drive from the base lodge.  
Overall, i expected more, and i know it is Arizona, but i still find it hard to believe that anyone can classify this as being a great place to ski or ride.  Anyone who can honestly say that this place  has great terrain and is an overall good skiing experience hasnt been to a  that has modern amenities, where you actually ski or ride for a greater amount of time than you are on the lift.  When you compare a $70 $80 lift ticket somewhere else to a $50 lift ticket at Snowbowl, there is no comparison in what you get for your money.

6955,2010-01-30,Pennsylvania,Liberty,5,"I love the mountain! I go here every weekend and carve it up. Snowboard teachers are great and the people inside the lodge are really nice. Snow conditions are great and the mountain trails are very diverse.  bunny hill is great for learning as it is extremely wide and it has a pretty good angle and some flat spots for practicing.  snow is wet and carve able which is good. I recommend this mountain, a great east coast .",Cody March
6959,2010-01-30,Vermont,Sugarbush,4,"I visited Sugarbush in January of 2010.  I had been here about 11 years ago, but don't remember too much of it.  re are 2 base areas at this  (the main one and the Mt. Ellen one).  I think most people start out at the main base area.   lodge/lift ticket building is very nice and looks pretty new.  y have a large cafeteria (with, of course, with expensive food like any  does) that reminds me very much of the ones out west I've been to.  It's very easy to access the mountain from this area.  re's a few lifts right outside of the lodge.  Once on the mountain, you'll notice that there is a huge variety of terrain.  I went straight for the blacks and double blacks so I'm not sure if the blues and greens are, but I did come with my dad who said they were.  So, nonetheless, the blacks and double blacks here are right on tap with blacks and double blacks at  Canyons, Park City, and Breckenridge.  I would say that the blacks aren't quite what blacks are at Alta or Snowbird or Mad River...but will still give you some challenge.   big plus for this place over Stowe or Mad River (the two other VT s i visited on this trip) is the vertical drop.  I think lincoln peak is around 2600' and Mt. Ellen is around 2700'.  So, you'll get a little more skiing time if you want to go down in run.  Unfortunately, there is no lift that goes from the base to summit....that's probably the only thing i wish this  had.  Anyhow, I'd say Sugarbush is the most ""complete""  I visited on this trip in terms of terrain quanitity and difficulty and for on site lodging.  Highly recommended!",Olivia
6962,2010-01-30,Utah,Snowbasin,4,This is one of the best kept secrets in Utah! A little out of the way from the major s but worth it!   city of Ogden is a cool old town with an empty mt.n right there! This is the home of the Olympic Super G too!  It can get really steep in places so get ready to bomb down. If Park City is crowded for the holiday or weekend   make the trip you will love the empty lines. It really is Park City on a budget.,wolfman
6963,2010-01-30,Colorado,Steamboat,4,"First time to Steamboat.  It was an early season deal we sailed in on so we weren't really expecting fantastic snow but I thought the conditions were good on the terrain that was open and each day we skied they got about 4 new inches of fluffy.  y opened a handful of new runs by our third day and I was happy to find a nice tree run to drop into.   snow that did fall was nice and soft, very good snow to soften up the groomers.  I'd really like to come back to Steamboat during peak season since about 2/3s of their terrain was closed.  It looked like there were a lot of nice cruising runs that would be great if under a blanket of pow.  re didn't look to be anything too gnarly out there, but just some nice cruising runs that would be fantastic under pow.  

 apres ski was fabulous!  We had a great time the first night between the Slopeside bar ($3 beer!) and Tugboat (Live band).  Saturday our group went downtown and hit some of the local bars.  I must've been having too much fun because I can't remember any of the names of the places we went.  We hit Strawberry Hot Spring too after skiing which was awesome, definitely recommend doing that on a clear night.  re was no moon so the stars were brilliant!  All in all, it was a great trip!  Can't wait to come back!",wolfman
6972,2010-02-01,West Virginia,Winterplace Ski,4,"We go to Winterplace every sunday (because saturdays are insanely crowded) and my wife goes 2 or 3 times during the week.  We finally, after 2 years of her wanting one, saved up enough to get her a brand new snowboard for christmas.  She had it for one month almost to the date and it was stolen while at Winterplace!!!!  You cannot take your skis or board inside the main lodge so therefore you leave them outside when you go in and just so you know there is no cameras on the deck, only on the ski racks!!!  She leaned it against the building, went inside to use the restroom and came back to no board.   reason I mention this is that out of several (5 or 6) employees that she talked to only one actually cared to help.   employees here are mostly young kids who have no respect or desire to help customers.  Bottom line is stop at the ski barn and grab up a lock to put on your board or skis when you go.  A few dollars is nothing compared to having your board and bindings stolen!!!!",andy D
6979,2010-02-01,Michigan,Big Powderhorn Mountain,5,"Just went to Big Powderhorn Mountain for some mid week skiing before my son went back to college. My son is a serious ""Boarder"" and pointed out some major improvements.

First, the ski hill is now owned by people who actually ski! So there are improvements all over.  terrain parks have many options and levels to test your spills. My son pointed out that the snow board instructors were actually the ones maintaining the course between lessons. Frequent maintenance coupled with knowledge and love of the sport. Sweet!

Fresh snow seems to fall daily. Much better feel than just man made snow. Some trails were left ungroomed and I encountered some 2 ft powder. 

My son thought the ""Crazy Trail"" might want to change to a black diamond as a warning to skiers/boarders. It can be tough with a stream jump as part of the trail.

My cell phone now works everywhere and the free internet wifi in the ski lodge at the base of the hill allowed me to give my knee a break in the action and check in with the office for messages and emails. That little addition should help people extend their get away, and still get some work done.",Mike134

No such luck  at least not early. Lines were very long. re were a lot of people that shouldn't have been on the intermediate trails skiing and boarding them. I suspect it was because the lifts to the beginner trails were even longer. Nevertheless, they were enjoyable trails. re were a few too many moguls at the top of one of the intermediate trails. I don't expect (or like) moguls on blue trails.  high speed quad was a treat though.  one beginner trail we went on was fun also. Will definitely go back  hopefully a weekday.",beachbumltj
6989,2010-02-02,Maryland,Wisp,4,"We went to wisp this year after they had 2 feet of fresh snow, and had a great time.  Our group was skiers and snowboarders, and there was something for everyone to do.   hotel we got nearby in oakland was affordable and chill.    was nice cause it had a lot of different types of terrain, and we were able to move easily from one side of the  to the other.   Mountain state brewing company just down the road had bomb fresh brewed beer, and rosmary flavored pizza with an old guy playing banjo.   great snow that weekend definately helped us have a good time, as we were able to do both chill wooded trails, moguls, fresh powder off piste, and the beginner trails.  Even my run in with the ski patrol left me feeling like the people were nice who worked there.

If you think this is going to be a big mountain, with advanced terrain and killer riding, you are wrong.  But if you are a well versed rider, and capable of having a good time, than it is worth the drive up from the city.  For local s, it beats liberty, white tail, and roundtop, but isn't as good as seven springs or snowshoe.  It is definately not vail, or the alps, so anyone who leaves there thinkiing it sucks, really only has themselves to blame.  

it could improve on some of the style of the lodge and the pumphouse restaurant, but the d.c.s bar was cool.

all in all it is a decent spot for Maryland skiing and snowboarding.",beachbumltj

6998,2010-02-02,Vermont,Smugglers' Notch,4,"I enjoyed smuggler's notch when I was there. Its a little bit easier on the wallet and the conditions seem to stay better longer than some of the other mountains in Vermont.  biggest draw back are the chair lifts. y are only two seaters and are painfully slow, averaging about 15 minutes to the top... That said, they extend for what seems like miles up into the clouds and you do get to spend a fair amount of time on the way down. Snow is great and well groomed, the glades are not as good as Stow or some parts of Killington, but they are still fun. 

I'm not sure how good it would be for families as you would indeed need to split up to make it up the lift lines. I believe they have a good instructional program though if you just want to dump the kids off somewhere.",swetsb

I can complain about this place forever.  Just avoid it and take a the extra time and drive somewhere decent.  Sooo never going here again.  Oh  and you need to pay extra money for a terrain park ticket.   park map is deceiving  you think there are 3 peaks, but there are not.  Its like a bunny hill, a longer 'hill' that starts a lil bit higher, then another hill that starts at the same place   just from another lift.  Total scam.    ",Debbi
7000,2010-02-03,Montana,Bridger Bowl,5,"Bridger Bowl is the quintisential gem in the rough. This is definately a local hill, and it caters to people who love to go big and have fun but could definately pass on the leather couches and 5 martini lunches in some five star restaurant. Bridger has absolutely fantastic advanced terrain and great expert terrain for those who would be willing to hike the ridge.  only problem is that they require you to have an avalanche transciever, even though it's only about 500' from the top of the lift to the top of the ridge. You can rent one, but I was cheap. I should have splurged because the pickings up there looked pretty darn good. However, you will find no shortage of lift served challenges here.  only major downside to this place other than its lack of ammenities (for those who need em), is the terrain park, which is next to nonesistant. However, since the whole mountain is essentially a huge terrain park, you won't necessarilly be wanting for air. Go jump off some rocks, because there are plenty with nice pillowy soft powder landings. This mountain is definately best for young 20somethings who want to hit it big and go party in a collge town after its all said and done.

However, if you are a flatlander looking for a family vacation, you might want to go with Big Sky. ",Dedmond
7001,2010-02-03,North Carolina,Wolf Ridge Ski,3,"Was there December 26 and had a lesson before trying to ski. Got lucky and there were only three of us in the class while I saw some classes with nearly a dozen members.  However the small class was not much of an advantage because the bunny sloop was incredibly crowded. Between the various classes, as well as people trying to learn to ski, there was almost no room to practice.  I think I am like most beginners and the thing that causes me to crash the most is coming too close to other skiers and the fear of knocking them down makes me hit the snow first.  This happend over and over again, as I would try start down the slope  and find I could not turn left or right without hitting another beginner or a line of ski school students.  and when you took the conveyor belt up, the least steep slope down (important to a beginner) took you straight into the area where the advanced skiers were flying down the mountain. It was very scary to have them wizzing by you as you tried learn to stop.

Maybe on a non holiday weekend it would be better but to be honest, the bunny slope was so small I think the place would have to be deserted for a newbie to be comfortable learning to steer and stop.",Dedmond

7009,2010-02-04,Oregon,Mt. Hood Meadows,5,"I moved to Portland recently and can't believe how lucky I am that such a nice ski area is so cose to town.  I'm sorry, but the other two nearby areas really aren't close to Meadows in terms of the terrain available and the number of places to go....I think people who have one bad experience get angry, post a review here, and swear they will never return.  Sure, the kids in the lift line could be a little snappier, and I *DO* wish they would figure out how to make their lift scanners work if I put my ski pass in the plastic sleeve of my ski jacket (A Basin, Taos, Sun Valley, Breck, and others seem to be able to do this with their scanners) ... but it's a great ski hill, and it's close to town!

As for the other service factors, I have had mostly very good experiences with the staff   welcoming and they do what they can.   instructors are generally nice, and while I wish they had a bit more graduated approach to their ski school (maybe more categories in the group lessons), the instruction has been good for me.   blue and black runs off the Cascade, Shooting Star, and Hood River lifts generally have the better snow and less traffic.  Again, I just don't see too much to complain about, and I think the $430 I paid for a season pass plus ski check is a heck of a lot cheaper than the big s in the Rockies.  Great deal!",drdevon
7010,2010-02-04,Idaho,Sun Valley,4,"SV has some real strengths, and one achilles heal if you have small kids 

 Town   We have skied almost every major  in the U.S. (and some in Europre) and found Sun Valley/Ketchum to have a unique charm based on its legendary history.  It is so much better than a purpose built ski village.  Ketchum (the town) is more upscale that Telluride and less show offy than Aspen.  re are enough good restaurants to try every night for a week and decent shopping.   town feels to be mostly inhabitted by retired West Coasters, but it is not an exageration to say that the avg age of the skier there is 65.   lodges on the mountain are incredibily nice (like Ritz Carltons)

Lodging   you will most likely stay at the Sun Valley Lodge which is good (not great) and is separated from town by a few miles.  Catching a bus, or getting a bellman to drive you to the mountain or town is easy enough assuming your family is not skiing at two different mountains.  

 biggest bummer about SV is that small children will be in ski school at Dollar mountain while anyone with an ounce of skiing ability will be at Baldy.  Timing shuttle buses to drop your kids off at Dollar in the morning and then getting yourself to Baldy is a drag.  Also, it is a bummer to not be able to check in with your kids during the day.  We will probably not go back to SV until all of our kids are old enough to ski at Baldy.   ski school at Dollar is fantastic however, the best we have experienced.   whole mountain is dedicated to kids.  My son never had more than 3 or kids in his class.  

Terrain  Best for intermediates and advanced with surprisingly little for beginners.   ""Green"" runs would be called ""Blues"" at any other  based on steepness and length.   bowls will keep advanced skiers satisfied but beware that there is no snow making in the bowl areas so you are dependant on natural snow conditions.  For true experts, Jackson Hole, Alta, or Whisler would be a better choice.  

I have read many complaints about the lack of snow at Sunvalley but we went at the end of January, right after SV received 2.5 ft of snow, and had great conditions.    moutain is very well maintained through snow making and grooming.   scenery from the summit is fantastic.

Overall a great place and more unique than anyplace in Colorado or Utah but taking shuttle buses from the lodge to town and two different ski mountains got tiresome with kids.

7012,2010-02-04,Nevada,Lee Canyon,2,"Coming from the Midwest I am used to skiing poor quality, so called s.  whole atomosphere was a turn off, rude parking attendents that looked like they just got out of rehab. You have to walk up a road that's packed full of cars, as angry motorists beep horns at you as you attempt to get to the top of the hill.. Only to find that the lift tickets are absurdly priced at near Colorado quality parks, $55 half day was way to much in my opinion, it truly should have been more around the $25 30 dollar range for the quality of skiing.  slopes were rock infested, and new snowboarders are in abundance. So watch yourself, I was hit three times and knocked over once by out of control boarders.  whole place lives up to it's Vegas, over priced name.

7022,2010-02-06,New York,Belleayre,4,"Really enjoyed skiing here last season.
Went up on Saturday Jan 2, 2010 for first time this season with a couple friends.

 cold really made the lift lines and stops while going up the lift lines seem really long.

 mountain is seperated into two halves keeps the beginners out of the way of the intermidate skiers.  Didn't see any colisions here as on other mountains.  
Very top face of the mountain turned icy later in the day due to the blistering wind and amount of skiers.
Super Chief lines were way too long as lift 7 was not operating.

Biggest con was as you wait in line your progress is stopped as more and more people go into the ski school line which doesn't alternate with the main cattle they take preference so the main line doesn't move at all while the school line goes to the top and returns while you are still in the line.

 best side of the mountain is served by the tomahawk lift which when we made it over there didn't have much of a line, 4 main runs off of this 2 of which were very icy but the other 2 were very enjoyable.

Two lodges one in the middle of the slopes and one at the base provided plenty of room.

Believe the advertisements that say Elk is the best in PA.   terrain is very good and varied (although mostly geared for intermediates and above).  Snow conditions and gromming have always been very good to excellent during my visits.   staff is friendly and helpful.   scenery is fantastic.  Elk is in a remote, rural stting   ....  you don't have to look at condos, highways, casinos or outlets (as you do at some other PA s).    mountain is laid out well and its easy to go back and forth between the interesting trails.   

Elk is all about the skiing ... not very commericial, no gimicks, limited terrain for boaders.  It has a fantastic old school New England ambiance ..... down to smelling the wood fire coming from the lodge when you are waiting for a chair  (just realize that you are in PA, so adjust your terrain and snow expectations accordingly).     lodge is nice.  Not glitzy ....  but to me, that is part of the charm.   cafeteria food is what you would expect at any  (I haven't tried the restaurant but I heard from a reliable source that its pretty good).   only down side, is that the lifts are slow.  y have the attached chairs.  However, if you go during off peak times, its not a serious drawback. 

No disrespect to boaders or beginners .....  but in my experience, I haven't seem many of either at Elk.  You are generally sourounded by pretty good skiers who are courteous and know the rules of the road.  Elk does have a very good ski school for children.  So the youngsters that learn there, are tought well and progress quickly.

We then went back to the room to get ready for bed since part of the family had an all day private ski school planned for the next morning.  As soon as we were sound asleep we were awakened by the loud voices and dj  and music at the bar below at 11:30.   college students and others were not only in the bar but out on the streets as if it were a street party until 2:15 in the morning.  This went on for several nights.  We called guest services each night of the intolerable loud noise to request security to come.   noise was so loud you could hear with earplugs in.  We even asked to be moved to a different room.  Needless to say there was not another room available and we had to endure this for 3 of the 5 nights.  This is why I scored Copper Mountain low for family.  Other than this nuisance, the vacation was wonderful.  We had to overlook the lack of sleep and noise to enjoy our vacation since security and guest services was unable to do anything about.  Mill Club 309 was beautiful and well decorated.   views were gorgeous from the room and the mountain.   mountain was setup for the advanced skier as well as the beginner and the slopes were groomed nicely each night.

We had beeline passes during the non peak season but definitely needed during late afternoon with the large number of students there.   restaurants were average but Chubs had yummy crepes.

Little Cottonwood Canyon has some of the best terran in Utah I think. After skiing in Big Cottonwood Canyon and Park City I enjoyed the variable terrain found at Alta and Snowbird the most. 

I liked how most of Alta's terrain was open right away. I mention this because Snowbird has a ton of great terrain, but if you are looking to get to that terrain, a lot of the access points are not open right away because ski patrol has to do avalanche control.

Go through the access points at Alta and you are going to be in heaven.  I would love to discuss where to go at Alta, but unfortunately I don't want to give up any secret stashes.

7051,2010-02-08,New Hampshire,Ragged Mountain,4,"  My 10 year old daughter, her friend and I visited Ragged for the first time on Saturday.  Granted, it was Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, but to be honest, it would not have mattered.  One three seat chair to one summit and one 6 seat chair to the other summit were the only chairs running except for the 3 seater in the beginner area.   lines were long, from 20 minutes up to 45 minutes.  One chair was down and the maps show another chair that goes most of the way up the summit, but it does not exist.  Trails are not marked or marked so poorly as to confuse people.  I heard many people talking throughout the day about how the trails are confusing.  Also, it stated that all trails were open, but they were not.  We were limited to one trail on Spear Mountain. due to time trials being done on another trail.  and on the main peak, we were limited to only a few trails due to trails being closed or not being able to find the trails. Even the beginner lift had a line that was over 15 minutes long.  It was sad to be in line waiting and looking up the slope and seeing almost no one on it.
   lodge (the Barn) was a mishmash of confusion.  Limited seating, personal items thrown everywhere, and slipper floors made it a nightmare to walk.  We witnessed two falls and one person falling with food, the soda landing on his chest and face.  Overall, with the poor line management at the lifts, only two lifts running to the summits, limited acces to trails, poor layout of the lodge and the price (which many people were grumbiling about   my cost per run was $7.75 per run with the ticket price of $62.00), it will be a long while before we return here.

7055,2010-02-09,New Hampshire,Bretton Woods,5,"Was up at BW this past weekend. Real cold all three days (each day started below  4F one day  37 with WC). High Pressure system in the area keep the big storm of the weekend from reaching up this far North. Snow that was groomed was fast and wide open, was there on a Thr, Fri, Sat. Clear skies all 3 days led to great views of Mt Washington and the Cog RR. Not typical you see the peak 3 days in a row.

Tough natural light after 2:00pm, low sun due to shortest days of the year.

BW was a little misleading with percentage open and terrain open. Some trails ""open"" hadn't seen snow natural or man made in a while, and hadn't been touched by a groomer seemed like all season. 

Can tell they are trying like crazy to open more terrain, fired up another quad on the Sat. to move people and opened a few more trails. Guns are on 24/7.

Some real great trails for kids or adults to learn on.

Staff is courteous and friendly, can tell they are still getting up to speed for the season. 

Overall, Good 1 weekend to shake out the rust and warm up for the season. Sure they'll have more open soon. ",Mark Lang

7071,2010-02-10,California,Heavenly Mountain,4,"Had a great week at Heavenly from Sunday Jan 24 thru Saturday Jan 30.  Snowed Sunday, Mon, Tues for plenty of freshies; then Weds half the mt.n (Nevada side) covered by clouds, but California side (Sky Express and Canyon lifts) had a beautiful sunny day;  Thursday was a true Bluebird day; and Friday was surprisingly less crowded than we anticipated.

I ski the blues and some blacks (not near as aggresive as I used to be!), go out west every year and to Vermont every year, so factor that into my review, but Heavenly was fantastic on many levels.  y got good snow the week before, but Heavenly does not get the snow that Kirkwood or even Squaw does based on how storms come over the mt.ns.  That said, the snow was plenty to cover all areas and have fresh stashes in trees on major blue runs for the first 3 days and into Thursday morning.  But I had heard many locals bemoaning how poor the snow had been prior to this week, and I had heard similiar things from past visitors.  Man made snow is better than none, but Heavenly doesn't really do itself favors by advertising its snow making capabilities    I go out west to avoid that very thing!!!

Anyway, plenty of fantastic runs from Olympic down through Stagecoach (rarely busy lifts) to the spectacular views off of Ridge to wandering thru the myriad of blues on the Nevada side.  Having been to Utah, I do not share the complaint of other reviewers that commented on traverses as the main ones used here (like getting to Olympic from the Gondola) is not bad so long as you know where you are going and build sufficient speed.

 reality of Heavenly is that if you want the back bowls of Snowbird or Crested Butte then go there and get extreme; if you desire a weeks worth of accessible runs along with the fun of casinos and beauty of Lake Tahoe (yes it is that breathtakingly beautiful) then I whole heartedly recommend Heavenly.   wife and I used Lake Tahoe Express for under $100 for the 2 of us rd trip, it saves money but can be slow if you arrive in the evening.

Those that live in Sacramento and the Bay Area are darn lucky to be able to drive here; we greatly enjoyed our vacation and would recommend Heavenly to anyone not looking for extreme skiing.  Even those who want a wilder ride can easily get to Squaw or other s to satisfy their wanderlust.  I would also say go later in the season (after mid Jan thru start of April) as from what I hear the snow is often better later there than earlier... 

All in all a great time, enjoyed the bar at the 19 floor of Harveys, free breakfast at Embassy Suites with easy walk to Gondola, sportsbook at Harveys    Heavenly would get a 4.5 if the ratings so allowed.  Worst part is on mt.n expenses    as much as Deer Valley but far less service.  $20 for (small) cheeseburger, chips, and Gatorade.  Not to mention $9 Jack Daniels and $8 beers.

Was very surprised at how family friendly Tahoe was in general and Heavenly in particular; we have a 3 yr old daughter and would feel great bringing her when she is 5 to learn from ski school (wife took an intermediate lesson and they were great).

To sum it up, just go enjoy all Heavenly has to offer and don't get too caught up in what might be perfect or imperfect.  If that fails, plenty of other s at Tahoe to choose from, and it just takes about 30mins to get there!  oh yeah, if you don't have to, avoid skiing Saturday and Sunday as Heavenly does get inundated with weekend arrivals.... but thats what makes midweek so nice and peaceful!",ONTHESHITER

7076,2010-02-10,New Mexico,Ski Santa Fe,4,"In my first two visits to this ski area, I saw one man standing at the racks who's skis had just been stolen, and then my son's snowboard was stolen.  When I asked about stepping up security (video cams, etc.) the management was very unconcerned and didn't seem to care.  So be warned...bring a lock or risk losing your stuff here.  This area is close to town and thieves drive up and nab your gear.
Also, they open up the upper mountain way too early.  Full of rocks, roots, and grass.  Not too often you fall and get up with grass sticking out of your boot.  and there is really only one blue way down from the Millenium chair (the good half of the upper mountain was closed)  So everyone had to keep to a crowded, rocky corridor.  Both my skis and my daughter's will need a full tune (they were freshly done prior to this).  Thanks, Santa Fe.
and bring your own food.  WAY overpriced, even for a ski .
Also, I've been to 11 different areas in NM, Colo., Utah, and Montana and never been whistled at, followed, held up, told to slow down like at Santa Fe by their Barney Fife style ski patrol.

7084,2010-02-12,Pennsylvania,Camelback Mountain,3,"at first i discounted camelback from my list of mountains to visit this winter due to all the negative press on this site, however, after much deliberation i've decided to give it a try since it was close to home (2 hrs from ny). and boy i was glad i did.

For readers, i went 2/6/2010 on a friday. II snowboard and considered myself beginner intermediate.

First, the staff was super friendly. I went into the booth to buy a camelpass (1/2 price lift, 3 visit FREE) and was asking the representative lots of questions. she was very helpful and understood why i was hesitant to drop 49 bucks for a pass that i wont use if the mountain sucked. she went out of her way to make sure that if i wasnt satisfied with the mountain, i'd get my money back for the camelcard. Good first impression. I paid $22.50 for a lift ticket with my camelcard. 

Next, the slopes cater to every skill level rider   almost. I must say, i can see how a expert will get bored with this mountain after a while. However, if your a beginner to advanced, and looking to improve your skills as a rider, this mountain has all level of green, blue and black to keep you occupied for an entire day.  great part about these courses is that there seems to be enough courses with varying difficulty levels of green, blue and black so a transition from, lets say, green to blue wont be too dramatic once you tried all the greens (minus bunny slopes). When you move up a color you feel challenged, yet at the same time, you know that its doable if you focus   a great feeling to have. Expect steep cliffs, hair pin turns, man made bumps, and sudden dips in later courses. I worked through all the greens from the main lift on the left side of the mountain to the right side, then blue in the same order and by the end of the day i was on blacks.

 most important thing is snow quality. I've been to some terrible mountains where the snow granuals are size of golf balls strewn across the slopes. However, i can tell camelback takes pride in their powder. Every single trail i visited there was evidence that the night prior the snow machines are out and grooming. Talking with the locals that frequent the mountain regularly, i was told that each an alternating trail gets fresh powder every other day. re are no rocks or sticks anywhere near the main slopes.  re are some ice patches, but i think thats from snowboards (myself included) just repeatedly pushing snow down the mountain.

y also have a halfpipe (gasp!) and what looks to be a great terrain park with huge jumps, obstacles, and stuff that will make your mother fear for your safety   Good! One of the locals told me you need to pay a small annual fee and watch a safety course video   Bad!  validity of this is yet to be confirmed, though i consider him a reputable source. 

 culture of the place is lively and friendly with its character changing throughout the day. Mornings from 9am to 3pm are mostly couples and families. From 4pm onwards, its mostly high school college aged kids and young adults looking to shred. Everybody is out to have a good time and sparking up conversation with strangers is easy going and spirited. 

So, great slopes, great snow, great variety all at a great price. So, what are you waiting for? Not so fast. Couple of cons you should be aware of. 

For a weekday it seemed to be a little bit crowded. (I cant imagine it on the weekends...) I had trouble finding my feet at first with all the people whizzing past me, but once i had found em' it was no problem. I was able to navigate through the crowd and still enjoy myself. Expect to keep an eye peeled out for people out in front of you.  crowd dies down, surprisingly, at 2 3PM and there were times at 3:15 i did runs without being able to count the number of people on one hand on the way down. 

Also, some of the trails seem a little short and you find yourself at the bottom thinking ""only if it were a little longer"". It definitely isnt a big mountain, but you will find yourself enjoying exploring the links between trails and once you do this, you will find a route that just resonates with you. In this regard, you get a good run in everytime once you familiarize yourself with the mountain. 

Lastly, one of my pet peeves is closed trails. Only a handful of trails, yes, but still. closed trails.


Overall, Camelback was great. Dont listen to the other people and judge for yourself. Hope to see you there.",cody hamlin
7085,2010-02-12,Pennsylvania,Liberty,4," My 2 friends and I ,all advanced intermediates, skied most of the day 2/9/10.  snow had just started about 1PM. 
 Conditions were fantastic.  powder was dry and light and fluffy. Not crowded at all. We skied all the runs. By 6:30Pm there was at least 6 7 inches of fresh powder and it just kept snowing all night.  We had to leave  to go home .  roads were plowed and pretty good when we left at 7:30PM.Tues.  
    people were very friendly.  runs were well maintained  and there is nothing wrong with their lifts as some one else suggested .  Occasionally lifts must be stopped for skiers who have fallen  at the bottom or top of the lift or even midway.  You can't always see what the problem is  most times it is the people causing the lift to stop.    terrain park was in great shape .  It is a small eastern  that does  everything they can to maximize their terrain. they are NOT a big Rocky Mountain .  snow yesterday was as good as any day I skied in the west on powder. I've skieed 70 differenet ski s so far and this small area does one of the best jobs I've seen.  ir flex tickets are my favorite part and you can go tubing too.  ir ski school is top notch   I'm a PSIA certified ski instructor (not teaching right now) and I can say that their instructors are well trained and dedicated.I have lived over 20 years in both  Park City Utah and Colorado and this place is a gem.  Yes it can get crowded on weekends like all ski s but it was heavenly yesterday and I heard they got 15 inches total of new powder.

7086,2010-02-12,New Hampshire,Attitash,4,"First time we have been at Attitash in a long time (20years). We went MLK weekend and had a great time on the slopes. Saturday the conditions after lunch were very icy and skied out.  area has not had any real snow in a couple of weeks so we were not to surprised by this. Sunday morning the conditions were great the mountain was nicely groomed and we all had a great time in the Parks all day long open to close. Sunday night they recieved about 5 6"" of the real stuff and made skiing on Monday morning absoltely great. Now on to the . We had a 2bd 2 bath condo across the street at the Attitash Mountain Village on a RCI exchange.  Condo was very clean. se condos are dated and the appliances are from about the late 80's to early 90's and are alittle noisy. It was a three level condo with the Master upstairs were the was no bathroom.  Also there was no way to get out of the third floorin the event of a fire.  top floor has two crank open skiylights but they would not open far enough to get out. y did provide a fire ladder, but I am not sure which window I would use in the event of a fire. Also we had to combine the dishes from the kithcenette on the second foor and the full kitchen on the first floor in order to serve everyone in out family of 5. If you are able to get into the  and stay slopesie or trailside those condo are much newer and are a much better option, but I was not able to find out where we were staying until the four oclock hour on check in.   was very admiant on this point to the point of being rude. I can understand it if the  is full, but talking with a few owners who were there they said that the  has been basically empty for the who winter. (Only owners are coming up this year) This has been the first  that would not let us check in a couple hours early.  I would definately go back if I had atleast three days of skiing, but I would probably stay somewhere else. ALso you are like 30 minutes from 4 other ski s in the white mountain valley.",DubbelSac
7088,2010-02-12,Colorado,Beaver Creek,2,"Skiied two days at Vail and then took the cattle car shuttle to Beaver Creek.  Big mistake.  conditions of the runs are average to fair if you ski the groomed stuff.  Neither  had much coverage, but the grooming at Vail was far superior. Most of the blue runs were scrapped off at Beaver Creek, which we only found at Vail at the end of the day on the return runs and because coverage was sparce in the trees and the steeps, not much to do and not a lot a variety.   top on the main mountain is mostly green runs.  I can't see how they justify charging the same price as Vail no comparison. It has a 10 of the area to ski.
Didn't have a car, so took the shuttle over from Vail.  It is a old, broken down, crowded green bus with limited room for skis, so many had to stand and hold there skis. Acceptable at some out of the way , but certainally not at a place pretending to be a top of the line .",isaac reule

It's short but steep.  other black diamonds (I don't do moguls, yet) were excellent as well. I'm a little better than intermediate skier and really enjoyed myself skiing the blues on the back side and the blacks on front and back.

7101,2010-02-13,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"Breckenridge never disappoints.  I can say it isn't the best mountain, or worst in the Summit Valley, but it is always nice.  Most all of the trails are groomed, the base snow is always good, and it is pretty wide open.  ",humanmap
7102,2010-02-13,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,5,"This hill really is an oxymoron. It's extremely laid back. It's a small giant. It's both fast and slow.

Steep, fast runs, and slow lifts. Extreme terrain, but everyone's relaxed about it. 

By far this mountain packs the most punch per square acre than any other mountain than probably Silverton.  average pitch of this hill has to be over twenty degrees, which makes for some excellent skiing.  Montezuma bowl, while icy when I skiied it, offers a nice southern and sun facing exposure that I'm sure is quite refreshing on sunny days right after a storm or when it softens up in the spring.  rest of the mountain has pretty much everything, except on a smaller scale than it's other Vail  brothers. re is a lot of fun to be had off the east wall, especially jumping off all those rocks. and nothing really quite compares to skiing above tree line. 

Plus, their proactive approach to consrvation is refreshing.

 only downside: it is small.  runs are not especially long, and a vast majority of the mountains named runs can be skied in a couple of days. If they had any high speed lifts, the mountain could be skied out in just one day.",humanmap
7103,2010-02-13,Colorado,Vail,3,"I've visited Vail twice in the past two years   both times for long weekends late in the season (late March).   first time out we split our time between the frontside and the famous back bowls, the second time around we concentrated mostly on the back bowls and blue sky basin.  Whatever you want, steep frontside groomers, long bump runs, trees this mountain has it all   and if you are lucky enough to get a powder day you can still get untracked lines (if willing to find them) till late in the afternoon.  Our group contained all ability levels and everyone came away happy.  Only experienced lift lines on one day (powder day).  Only downsides were the price (def not cheap to ski, stay or eat) and meeting up with other members of our group.  Since Vail is so big it can take quite awhile to meet for lunch if experts (want to ski bowls and basin) are trying to meetup with beginners (frontside greens and blues).",humanmap
7104,2010-02-13,Colorado,Keystone,5,"If you are a beginner, I would strongly urge you to ski elsewhere.   greens that they do have are incredibly lacking.  First, the majority of the gree terrain has been relegated to trails the width of country rd    if that wide.  You're essentailly snow plowing the entire way down while more seasoned skiers fly by in close proximity     not a good learning environment.  Second, Keystone has mad a horrible mistake by placing the Terrain park at the other end of a green run (probably the only nice run there is), subsequently, 100's of testosterone charged boarders come crashing down the run almost out of control to get to the park.  I don't blame them too much becuase much of the run is flat and they need the speed to carry them through.  

n, when you feel you are up to skiing a blue you find hills that could easily be found on black???  What's up with that???  re are soooo many better option for begginer skiiers, so please avoid Keysone until you built up some experience.   staff was very friendly and they took good care of grooming the trails.",humanmap
7106,2010-02-13,Massachusetts,Wachusett Mountain,5,"I've had a night season pass for the past few years so they are doing something right.  That is the basis for my review,  given a choice, I'd head up north if I were going to ride during the day strictly based on size of the mountain.

 First I'll say what the mountain is.
It is reasonably close for a few hours of late night riding whether you live in Springfield, or Boston, or anywhere in between.
It is well groomed twice a day so ice is kept to a minimum despite traffic until spring.  This is the best decision management has made,  and it is why I keep coming back.  Being a smaller mountain, it's manageable to do this daily.  You always have a chance at riding corduroy!  
Food is on par for a , and the bar is decent.  Ticket prices are as expected for a smaller mountain.
 lodge is clean, well kept, and you can tell money has been put into it to make it nice.  It's comfy.
Free ski check is such a convenience and keeps things secure.  Please tip the kids who work there, they are super nice!
Trails are decently wide and support traffic pretty well.
at certain times, family trails are monitored, I have seen kids talked to for going too fast.  I think it is reasonable.

Now, for what it isn't.
It has varied terrain, but it's not a huge mountain. I mean, it's Worcester not Vermont.  It is bigger than most Connecticut ski places that have night skiing.  You have to give up something for convenience.  I'm fine with that.
It doesn't have a half pipe, that ceased to exist however it sounds like it is more of a political issue with certain groups. I  was looking forward to using it when I first started coming but it is gone gone gone.
School kids crowd it after school until 7 or so during the week and that is my biggest gripe.  I could overlook it more if I felt management was doing something to repremand the kids for being snotty and rude, like pulling passes, etc.  I have  never heard such racist and homophobic slurs from such young kids before in any  lift line, I can honestly say I'm sometimes shocked at what I hear.  I listen to my iPod now and catch the last few hours at night to avoid these brats.  I do understand after school programs are probably a cash cow and help support the mountain, so I can understand why the kids are there but it's annoying sometimes.
 big terrain park is kept up well, however the smaller one is left to ice over and die. Last year the rail garden was rutted out and iced due to traffic and no upkeep. It was safer to avoid it.

 park could use more long slideable fun features.  I've seen videos from parks out west (skibrighton.com).  I notice not as challenging stuff (as the Wa Wa current park has, like jump on features, which are good), but 30 foot low boxes to slide, low ""S"" rails to balance on, 30 foot mail boxes.  se would make a good addition to the park.  Bigger isn't necessarily better.

 last gripe is the terrain park fee, however I do understand it probably keeps out little kids that tend to barge and be a nuisance, since mom and dad won't buy it for them.  I've had enough  of that at other places, and sure enough the kids I see in the park generally can handle themselves and know the rules.  I'm sure it probably does something to limit liability for the .

It's not VT but it certainly blows away CT s for night riding.  I'm happy.",medford_mike

7116,2010-02-14,Maryland,Wisp,4,"Have visited the  off and on for 25 years.  Mainly because it is close to home.  Many improvements over the years especially recently. Advanced and aggressive snowmaking are major plusses.  While the veritcal is limited they have done the best they can do with the mountain.   terrain layout is not ideal but it works.  It is uncrowded during the weekdays and a pleasure to ski then.  We avoid the weekends, especially Saturday.  Crazy crowded.  Recently, in the past week have had ski condtions I have not seen even out West.  Skiing in powder over my knees and occasionally to mid thigh.  Undoubtably the finest ski conditions I have ever seen in the east.  We get annual passes for the family because it is quick to get here but this year has been  a skiing delight.  Enjoy.",purplebunyz
7132,2010-02-16,Pennsylvania,Roundtop Mountain,4," I have skied Roundtop, Liberty and Whitetail as well as many other areas. I like Roundtop because it keeps all the trails for the same ability level pretty much in separete areas. If you ski expert trails you don't have to mix with the beginners.  It is a little harder to get to  being far off the main highway om confusing back roads but it is worth the drive. 
  I just wanted to respond to a previous comment.  I have worked and lived at several ski s in the west and in the east.   reason areas are roped off between trails in the Pennsylvania s is that the only snow making is ON the actual trail.  y lay down a good packed base and then keep blowing snow on top of the base. y have combed the trail when there is no snow and taken out the big rocks and other obstacles. Since Pa does not normanlly get  a lot of natural snow there is usually a very small amount of snow between the trails and most of the tiime there is no snow between trails where there is no snow making.   roped off areas are for your safety. It ususally means there isn't enough snow to cover the rocs,etc and there is no base of packed snow for you to ski on. You would hurt yourself if you tried to ski in these areas. It may look like a good place to ski if there has been a fresh snowfall and the ground has snow on it  but you don't know what IS UNDERNEATH THAT SNOW. 
     Out west  they  take out more obstacles between runs and they get enough snow to make it feasible to ski the trees  but that unfortunately isn't the case in Pa. Compare 350 plus inches of natural snow which is average for annual snow fall at western s with maybe 30 40 inches of natural snow in Pa in a normal year. Not of couse like this past week. 
     Sometimes you have to trust the ski areas  they have your safety in mind. 
   Another thing  you are correct in saying Liberty Mountain has a bigger beginner area  however to get a nice big area like that they actually had to move  the path of a county road and litteally move a small mountain to grade the area.   land wasn't naturally like that. It did however make for a really great learning area. I do reccommend Liberty for the best learning area around Pa. Most beginner areas aren't as long ,wide or have as  gentle terreain or served by their own chair lift. ",Dave O

We proceeded to the rental line and after waiting 90 min our line stopped moving. We were told that the other line (100+ people) would be serviced completely, then our line would restart, due to understaffing and computer issues. We were told we would not receive skis for at LEAST another hour!  I realize this is the Friday before a holiday weekend, but we parked in the first of four lots, and this first lot was about 60% full. We had to get the attention of an overstaffed worker (polite kid) to learn that we could get a refund, We then had to wait for his return to learn where to get a refund. So our options were

1) Get our money back, equating to taking a day of vacation to leave home at 7:20AM, returning at 2:30PM, to do nothing but drive, stand in line, get lunch, and return home. or
2) Pay $300 to arrive at 9AM, start skiing after 12 noon (if we skip lunch) with our lift ticket expiring at 4PM. This assumes that there would have been ski's after our wait. I doubt this since while having our refund processed, we hear more than once on walkie talkies that they are out of skis.

After returning home,.we called customer relations mid afternoon the same day. ir response was that this is a holiday weekend and we should have known this could happen, followed by a curt ""I'm sorry"", then hanging up. I can understand the principle of a busy weekend, but when you arrive at 9AM and the lots are <20% full, its time to step up and admit your faults. Although hard to do, the customer relations department failed more so than the ski rental building.

Next time we drive a bit further to a better mountain, and we're sure to share our exerience with those who ask.

7140,2010-02-16,New Hampshire,Mt. Sunapee,3,"Nice place to ski for a day trip. My 11 year old and I decided to take a day trip since we had never been there before. All in all a nice place to ski if you like the easy cruisers.  diamonds are weak but nicely groomed. If you like more natural terrain and glades then it just OK. y do have a couple of really nice glades, but most are pretty short and would probably rate as a blue or black at smuggler's notch or stowe not a double diamond. I would be somewhat bored if we were there for more than a day, but we are more partial to natural skiing and less groomers, with that said the grooming was excellent.  We would go back for aa day trip, but not much more than that for us. It looked like they had a really good learning area that included a beginner glade. ",thesnowboarder

We were going to go to powderhorn for three days but went to powder horn for 1 and indianhead for 2 because indianhead was so much better.  snow, lift lines, and difficulty of runs were all better.

7148,2010-02-17,Idaho,Schweitzer,5,"Schweitzer might just be Idaho's best skiing experience. It might not have the luxury or the vertical, or wealthy ambiance that Sun Valley has, but when it comes to actually skiing, this  is one of a kind.

Tree skiing here is the best I've encountered, and there are a few reasons for this. One is that the  is located entirely on private land, which means they can log and thin as much as they want to without having to deal with the Forest Service, which the vast majority of other western s must deal with. y purpose cut glades to make a unique skiing experience. Another reason is that there is such interesting tree diversity, from larches that shed their needles to give an aspen like experience, to firs and absolutely giant cedars that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere outside of the pacific northwest.

re are also some good steeps if you are seeking a good thrill. Nothing insanely steep, but there are some 40 plus degree chutes on both the front and the back sides of the mountain that will pose a challenge to even the most well seasoned skier. 

 terrain park is the best in the state, given that Tamarack has now been shuttered, and they build it up more and more as the season goes on.  terrain park has its own dedicated space, so all the features are found on one run, rather than scattered throughout the hill.

 groomers are wide, and the hill is well laid out. re is plenty of vertical to get your legs burning, and the size of the  is such that even after day three or four, you can still find yourself exploring new areas. 

 only real downsides to this place is the weather, which tends to bring in an overabundance of cloudy days. If you don't especially like skiing flat light, you do best looking elsewhere. Also, and unfortunately, this  does not directly link up with the town of Sandpoint.  road is only seven miles, which is not too bad, but fully integrated towns/ski hills like Aspen and Sun Valley do offer a bit more convenience. However, Sandpoint is a great town that should suit anyone not specifically seeking out the glitz of major s.",mir0yan222
7149,2010-02-17,New York,Catamount Ski Ride Area,3,"We booked a last minute Presidents weekend trip here after we couldn't get our kids into any ski school basically in the northeast. Wasn't too sure what to expect after reading reviews, but wow was I pleasantly surprise. I have 3 kids ages 4, 8, and 10 all of which have never skied before.  ski school was awesome. y got the 8 and 10 year old on lifts by the end of the first day.  instructors were young and energetic.  staff  running the school were organized and very helpful (especially Marie). re weren't any lines at all throughout the whole weekend. ANy line we waited on was in the beginner area, which is great for those who are learning and want a variety of trails.  mountain is filled with families. Having skied many places throughout the Northeast, we will be back to Catamount soon. ",R Lee Stump
7152,2010-02-17,Wyoming,Jackson Hole,5,"For those advanced/expert skiers looking for a good review, this one probably won't be too helpful. For those relatively new, hopefully this will be of some value.

This was my first experience at Jackson Hole and it's pretty clear that I'll be back next year. I came to the mountain as a barely blue skier and left far more confident in my abilities on the slopes.  mountain lives up to its reputation of having challenging terrain and the instruction I received definitely helped me push my boundaries on it.

 first few days of the trip were total bluebird without a recent heavy snowfall, but the groomers I stayed on were perfect. Later in the week the snow began to fall and conditions improved greatly for those of us lingering on the lower part of the mountain. Be sure to prepare yourself for greatly varying weather conditions   a morning of being dressed too warmly can change into an afternoon of cold and heavy snowfall.

 mountain staff were helpful and polite.  instructors were enthusiastic and very much in tune to individual abilities. As for après ski/etc, you could spend a week at the village and do alright (be sure to hit the Mangy Moose), but I recommend heading 20 minutes into the town of Jackson for a bigger variety of dining and things to do (beer lovers would dig Snake River Brewery).

7163,2010-02-19,New Hampshire,Mt. Sunapee,5,"I went here. Mistake. Crowded, crowds mean beginners going down trails too difficult for them, which leads to sliding down the whole thing, which leads to ice.  top is really windy. re's 1 high speed quad  which I saw some pretty disturbing this on... the top is extremely windy and there's no way out from the East side bowl or whatever you want to call it. This doesn't really help when you dislocate your shoulder on ice. You can see Okemo from the top of the North peak though!",Three2Ski
7164,2010-02-20,Vermont,Bromley Mountain,5,"First trip ever to Bromley was truly a pleasant surprise... had avoided it due to lack of elevation, lack of vertical rise and small size... My mistake!  Went MLK day (Ok, maybe the 6"" fresh pow helped... and the $39 lift ticket special) but the place delivered.   right side... especially Havoc, Stargazer, Blue Ribbon and Corkscrew/Pabst Peril & Panic were great fun and with the fresh pow... and ungroomed... bumps on every run... simply awesome.  I was told the right side of Stargazer being open was rare... and worth it.  Avalanche glade was great too.

I dare say my 11yr old and I found opportunities for plenty of fresh tracks even well into the afternoon... I'm guessing with the freshie, the ""good"" guys/gals went to the bigger s... no matter, they left the fresh tracks for us... and we didn't complain... we just enjoyed the day!",Bill Deaton
7165,2010-02-20,Pennsylvania,Montage Mountain,2,"I had a Montage Mountain season pass for years, and I still ski Montage Mountain once or twice a year.  Great local hill within easy reach of a large amount of people.   lodge is at mid mountain (watch that access road in poor conditions   it's well maintained but too well maintained so over confident speed causes various accidents).   lodge is nice enough with a nice bar, but the place is a zoo during busy periods.  If carrying all sorts of gear from the car, watch out for the stairs from parking to lodge.  re's usually a shuttle.   park is top notch and makes the ""Iron Horse"" Triple lift more popular.  Last I was there, they had a superpipe and halfpipe.  It also adds flavor to an upper mountain that is rather bland.   upper mountain beginner trails are nice for newbies, but short for more adventurous beginners... don't sweat it, the blues are all managable by beginner skiers.  All the upper terrain is a series of short headwalls to flats and is very exposed (windy and cold).  Sno has recently added a new blue route on the far perimeter of the upper area, which was an extension of a jug handle off ""Upper Fast Track"".  y also put a glade on the trail map off this trail.  Nice to see the embrace of tree skiing, but sad to see my OB lines put on the trail map.   whole upper mountain is mostly widely spaced and narrow trees ideal for easier tree skiing, but elevated trail side snowmaking lines makes skiing/riding these trees very hazardous.  Recent snowmaking upgrades have been great.  I have found real good conditions on my reent visits, even tower mount dustings on some trails over night.   grooming is adequate, not anything stellar or particularly bad.  Sno boasts 1000' feet of vert which is among the tops in the state.   top to bottom ""Runaway"" trail is managable by intermediate skiers.   lower mountain has some steep sections to it.  ""Lower Runaway"" was formerly a diamond trail, but is now rated double blue I believe. ""Runaway"" and ""Fast Track"" have upper and lower sections and run top to bottom (served by the long and pokey ""Long Haul"" triple).  I find these runs to be wonderful.  If the area ever put in a high speed lift, it is conceivable the ""Long Haul"" would be replaced serving these runs, but Montage Mountain patrons have become so accustomed to avoiding this lift (other then the 'change of pace' lift ride).  This makes for longer lines at the lower mountain quad chair and the upper mountain beginner triple chair from the lodge.  re is a new diamond trail (""Rattler""?) that cuts from ""Lower Runaway"" to ""Cannonball"" that is fun (mellow but narrow).  ""Cannonball"" is a favorite, rolling and winding diamond, that cuts from the lodge between the ""Long Haul"" triple trails and the ""Phoebe Snow"" quad trails on the lower mountain (the North Face).  ""Smoke"" has one real steep headwall, and ""Boomer"" is a great trail when it has moguls.  Watch out for ""White Lightning"".  One of the steepest trails in the state, and usually wall to wall moguls.  It's really challenging, and gets steeper from top to bottom.  Just when you think: ""is this it? not so bad..."", it rolls over to a steep section of scattered, icy bumps from side scrapers and dead liners.  Some hard G's when it suddenly flattens out. Montage Mountain has an exit off I 81, and the access road has lots of stores and some things to do (great movie theatre, Lackawanna Cty. Stadium, Glenmaura National Golf Club).  Out of towners could make a neat trip staying in the city and spending a day at Montage Mountain.  I personnally think the city lights at night are a cool benefit as most mountains don't have such a view, but many disagree.   I hold a place in my heart for Montage Mountain (I still call it Montage), plenty of pros, plenty of cons, but just a great local hill.  ",Bill Deaton
7180,2010-02-22,Colorado,Copper Mountain,4,"I visited Copper on Febraury 3, 2010.  It is located right beside I 70, so very easy to access.  A shuttle takes you from the parking lot to the village. All lifts are 4 person high speed, which is nice.  Once at the top, the mountain its self is average.  Lots of straight slopes going to the base.  Not much of a variety.  
Conditions were not the best that day such as hard groomed slopes with icey patches.  I do realize that Copper cannot control the poor conditions.  After I was tired of going straight up and down, I decided to try the trees.  Bad mistake.   trees are very dense and numerous stumps/rocks were visible.  This is partly due to the lack of snowfall.  After getting my butt kicked in the trees, I tried to make it to the closest slope, what a workout.
 most enjoyable part of the day was sitting on the patio drinking a beer and watching everyone bust.  Not a good day at an average .  After visiting other CO s, Copper just does not compete with the others.",bandanasFTL
7181,2010-02-22,Colorado,Steamboat,5,"In short, save yourself some money and ski better lines/deeper powder elsewhere. You may get lucky and get snow, but compared to Jackson Hole, Grand Targhee and Utah (Little Cottonwood Canyon), you'll see that Colorado consistently receives about 150 inches less of total snowfall annually. Exactly how do they justify the extreme lift ticket prices?

I hear nothing but raves about Colorado. I'm guessing it's because I live in Minnesota, and Colorado is the nearest getaway to the mountains. I hear nothing but good things from people about Colorado. 
I think maybe those who rave have never been elsewhere.  Or have endless $$. Or prefer mellow groomers over back country.
Maybe I say this because the other places I've been to have been Jackson Hole, Grand Targhee, and Utah. All I can say, is compared to those, I felt depressed and robbed at Steamboat
 part that really got to me was how I ended up in Steamboat. I helped my girlfriend drive her car out to UCLA, and so I brought my new rockered fat skis. We stayed in SLC on New Years Eve, and although l could have bought lift tickets to Park City, Snowbird or Brighton for $45 (Alta for $62), I would have felt bad making my girlfriend spend the $90 $100 to rent skis and get a lift ticket to ski by herself most of the day since she didn't have her own gear and can't do the terrain I do. (I know, I'm a bad boyfiriend, keep in mind I'm in college) It was snowing nicely too in Utah

On the way back to Minnesota I made a detour to Colorado to spend my birthday with my cousin and her school friends. Although I knew in advance that lift tickets to Steamboat ran for $95, I figured I had three weeks to find a cheap ticket. I was WRONG. I ended up spending $95 on my birthday to ski crappy snow and unexciting terrain (relative to the places I've been)

In short, I would have been far better off just paying the $90 for my girlfriend to rent skis and ski by herself in Utah.  $135 $140 for two skiing epic powder on beautiful terrain would have been faaaaaaaaaaaar more valuable than the $95 it costs to ski junk at Steamboat.

I wish I could have made this review shorter, but Steamboat/Colorado ruined my birthday. Never again. 
Argh.......


but hey, on the positive side, they had a pretty decent progression terrain park, and the big park had some nice rails with big tabletop style landings.

7197,2010-02-22,West Virginia,Canaan Valley,5,"Took advantage of the mid week ski & stay package at the Canaan Valley Resort and skied one day at Timberline and one day at Canaan.   package was a great deal (1 night's lodging plus 1 day lift) and the mountain was virtually empty on a Friday.  Overall, the terrain was much more varied and interesting at Canaan (Timberline basically has 10 lines down the mountain that they sandbag up to claim > 30 runs).  When we were there (mid Jan) there was only one short bump run (out of > 30), and only 1 open glade.  Overall would rate it a better hill for beginners and intermediates, if you're looking for something more challenging and you're stuck with West Virginia I'd say head to Snowshoe.",skijds
7199,2010-02-22,Virginia,Massanutten,3,"This is a decent sized  with a broad difficulty range. re are plenty of lifts and they can handle the weekend capacity (the longest lines were no more than 5 minutes of waiting).  parking for us was good enough to run by the truck for lunch and just far enough that we could make it without collapsing after a marathon day. I purchased the lift tickets for Friday and Saturday at the same time so I got their multi day special which means that you get night skiing and rentals free for both days and you only have to pay the 8 hour rate for both days. ($30 Friday w/ student discount and $64 Saturday). $94 for two 10+ hour days of boarding sounded good to me.  snow was better at night when it gets colder and stops sticking together, but while it's warm you get what we call mashed potatoes that makes the the runs rough and rutted, they should really groom the runs between day and night sessions but they don't so bend your knees. Night slopes are well lit. Expect big crowds if you are going on the weekend and watch out for fog in the afternoon and evening especially at the top of the mountain.

I should also note that my friends got to ride all day both days and they only bought 4hour half day passes, they just don't check tickets i guess.",vadoc
7200,2010-02-22,Virginia,Wintergreen,4,"Me and the wife visited Wintergreen over the Presidents day weekend and on into Wednesday 17 Feb 2010.  Sunday was a little packed but on Monday conditions were good and the slopes were groomed.  I see myself as an intermediate skier and I felt like the ski slopes were set up nicely for beginners with so challenging terrain for those who venture into the black diamond slopes.   blue and the green slopes are short but wide open.  re was alot more terrain and longer runs when I went over to the Diamond runs.  If you ski the blacks there is a Moguls slope, there is a good terrain park, and about six somewhat challenging slopes to ski.  We stayed at the Wintergreen Resort lodging.   rooms were great, comfy, and convient. We didn't have a ski in ski out room but there was a shuttle that ran every 10 15 minutes and we were very satified with the accomedations.  I would definetly recommend Wintergreen if you have small children, looking for affordable prices in you skiing, and if you don't care about short runs on the blue or green slopes.  If your looking for more terrain, longer runs, and don't mind spending a few more dollars then I would go to Snowshoe in WV.",vadoc

He also provided a vegetarian option for 2 women in my group for the lunch & the dinner. y greatly appreciated the effort. Mother Nature deserves some credit for providing us with unheard of ""spring like"" temps & blue skies in mid January.  snow was excellent and lift lines were amazingly short, despite it being MLK Jr. weekend. My group of 30+, was a mix of singles, couples & families (skiers & boarders). All had a great weekend and want to return next year for not only the skiing but the Brewski fesival as well. What a blast!  only thing I will change will be our accomodations.  units across from the main lodge were very old and too cramped for the families. A few had odd odors. Next year we will opt for the trailside condos which appear better suited for our needs. Looking forward to next season already. Sitzmark loves the U.P. AND Indianhead!

7207,2010-02-23,Michigan,Big Powderhorn Mountain,5,"This place is awesome! It was a January night, really cold but no wind and the snow was really fluffy.  y have really come to welcome boarders.  Have made major improvements in their terrain parks since last year and they leave a lot of powder around. For a free rider it's like surfing on a cloud.  runs are super wide and long so you don't spend the whole day on the lift. That's just during the daytime.  

Once the sun goes down the real fun begins.  y don't have a ton of lights so it's not just replacing the sun but rather the runs have just enough light to help you see where you're going so it's a really trippy, true night boarding experience.  re is one part on the lift where it just carries you from the light into the abyss of the pitch dark and the only thing you can see in front of you is the white snow underneath. Hard to tell how far away it is to the ground so it's a really surreal feeling. n you look back down the mountain and the main lodge is totally lit up with this glow that kind of reminds you of the North Pole at x mas. It gives you the most amazing feeling! I remember just instantly being in a great mood. 

n to top it off, that particular night there was the most amazing full moon I have ever seen.  It was the coolest shade of red and when my friend pointed it out it seemed to just be sitting on the top of one of the adjacent runs as if you could just walk up and bask in it's glow.If I could have gotten a midair pic doing a stalefish or a cool grab off a kicker with that in the background it would have made a magazine cover for sure. 

I've ridden at numerous hills in the midwest that offer night riding but they're really just the same runs both night and day.  re is something magical about the way the runs are lit at the ""Big Pow"" that really make the riding different from day to night. I will still ride at night other places but will constantly be talking about how much cooler it was at Big Powderhorn.",mkt
7216,2010-02-24,New Hampshire,Mt. Sunapee,4,"I love Sunapee.  It is only about 75 minute door to door, the snow is great whether early, peak, or late season, and they take really good care of it.  

 learning area is really nice with it's own dedicated quad and free of most of the older crazy kids.  re is a warming hut there too which is nice for the little ones.  It's a decent walk over to the magic carpet but not unmanageable.  Weekdays it's a great mountain and they have a lot of deals midweek.  On weekends during prime season the lodge can be so crowded that you cannot sit anywhere especially if there is race stuff going on.  This is not only at Sunapee though as you probably know most mountains are crowded on weekends.  Parking is usually not too bad if you get there early.  My kids really enjoy this place.  Great views of Mt. Washington and Okemo too I think...

7221,2010-02-24,Colorado,Telluride,5,"Compared to skiing at Zermatt, Whistler, Jackson Hole, Taos, Snowbird, and Mammoth Mountain I would say without question Telluride is on an even higher level.  terrain, beauty, and rugged sophistication of the two towns put this  at the very top of my list.

It's crazy how this place can ski steeper than Jackson Hole, provide over the top luxury like Beaver Creek and still maintain its truly authentic and unpretentious character   something unseen in the world of skiing.  vertical is higher than Jackson Hole and the new terrain they've opened in the past few years makes me speechless (Palmyra Peak! Revelation Bowl, Black Iron Bowl)

Telluride is so uncrowded that it's hard not to be in awe. You feel like a movie star on your own private mountain.  two towns are awesome!  European Mountain Village compliments the rugged mining town of Telluride. and everything is connected by one of the sleekest gondola systems in the world. Ski Telluride over anything.

7224,2010-02-25,New Hampshire,Pats Peak,3,"To be honest, I hate this ski area. I was okay with it last year but only because the only trails I went on were the bunny slopes. I'm more of a higher level intermediate now and it is really boring. If you want to get to the only ""fast"" lift you have to hike uphill. ir other lifts are located practically in the parking lot probably just so they can add another 100 200 feet of vertical. A lot of their terrain has flat parts that are almost impossible to get through. I used their rentals, which by the way seem to get bigger every week, and their bindings were falling off, the laces are extremely hard to tie and the boards don't have stomp pads. I cut my fingers up trying to get the boots tied.  bindings were so loose that I kept slip sliding around on black diamonds that I am normally confident on  not safe at all. It takes maybe 10 30 minutes to get to the summit which can take longer and usually does due to newbs falling off every other second. y also advirtised on their website that they had all trails and lifts open, but one of the lifts doesn't exist and some are not even set up yet. I would gladly take my money to Crotched a better layout and much more vertical and it's cheaper in terms of lift tickets.",eewdad
7227,2010-02-25,Wisconsin,Granite Peak,5,"This was my first trip to Granite Peak in many years.  Pros:  Lots of challenging runs to choose from, you are not likely to get bored here   but not a great place for beginners or weak intermediates, the headwalls will force you to execute with very good technique or you will pay dearly, well groomed and conditions improved during the day, fast lift lines   some of the best organized lift lines I've been in for some time, lots of lodge space and parking   Cons: Customer service varies, some of the people handling lift lines are just rude.  I found out that Granite Peak puts bar codes on their lift tickets and then expect to scan them in lift lines.  If it can't be scanned they COULD deny you lift access and ask you to go get a new ticket, so if you go be sure you don't wrinkle your ticket like I did, I took a lot of hassle for this.  High prices for tickets and food.  I bought my ticket in advance on line, in addition to the lift ticket price there is a ""facilities improvement cost"" and state tax added, so its not really $50 cost.  Food is pricier than other hills, I paid over $6 for a bowl of chili and a cup of coffee.     Will I go back? Yes.  Cost and guest service downgrades this from a 5 star hill to a 4 star.   ",J
7229,2010-02-25,California,Heavenly Mountain,5,"Skiied Heavenly from 1/23/10 thru 1/29/10.  Had abundance of snow, very little lift lines, super friendly staff.   only negative I have is that my wife and I fell on untreated steps at the village.  We filled out a report at the Heavenly customer service office, and no one bother to follow up on it.  I had a sprained wrist, slight concussion and a bruised tailbone.  Only one individual ever asked how I was, and I happened to see him in the grocery store.  He came up to me and asked how I was doing. (Thank you ski instructor supervisor).   My first trip out west (I live in Ohio) I thought there may be a chance I could be injured skiing the mountain, I just didn't think it would be on a set of steps in the village.  Overall, great place and I would return at a moments notice!    views are the most awesome of anyplace I have ever been.  I couldn't ski for stopping to take pictures.  Lake Tahoe is within site of many of the ski trails.   trip on the Gondola to the top of the mountain will give you exceptional views and then you can ski to the bottom for an experience that you will only get at Heavenly!   I don't agree with all the bad rap on traversing.  It is a huge mountain with many trails and lifts, and traversing is not that big a problem. ",keneikirk
7230,2010-02-25,Colorado,Silverton Mountain,5,"Let me start off by saying that if you're considering skiing or riding here you should.  It is definitely a cool experience.   San Juans are so different compared to other mountains in CO.  

I went with a friend in mid January and we both agreed that it was definitely worth the time and money.   snow conditions were actually pretty poor the day we rode there.  Our guide made up for it by taking us on some really cool terrain.  

Prior to going I read some reviews on this site.  I wouldn't put too much faith in any of these (the negative ones).  You just need to try it for yourself.  If you have a positive attitude and are in somewhat good shape the guides will definitely try and show you the best time possible.  We took three runs the day I went (they were all cool in different ways).  Our group hiked to billboard the first run, took a heli over to a cool chute for the second and rode some trees the final run.   helicopter is only a $150 for a drop!   ride is about a minute or two but it's so worth it.

 only thing negative I can say about the place is that if you get put in a group that isn't on the same riding/hiking ability as you it could be frustrating (This didn't happen to me.  My group was awesome).  I think if this happened you could always voice your concern to the guide.  y'd probably try and put you in a different group if possible.  I was with two of the guides for the first run and talked to a third later in the day.  y were all super nice. 

 emphasis on danger was kind of funny.  I'm not saying that something bad couldn't happen but I think they remind you of it a little too often.  y will take you on a hike that you could easily roll several hundred yards down the mountain and won't think/say anything of it but as soon as there is any danger on your board or skis that's all they seem to want to talk about.   hiking in my opinion was more dangerous than the riding we did.  I didn't see this as a negative though.   hiking was cool!

Bottom line is that it's a cool place and I had a memorable time.  I will do it again.  If you don't want to hike or you plan on taking 20 runs this probably isn't the place for you.   only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because the snow conditions weren't the best.  That may be unfair because I don't think there's anything they can do about that.",runner/skier
7231,2010-02-25,Colorado,Purgatory Mountain,5,"Been going to Durango for years and love it.   only downside to the  is that there is very limited backcountry/off piste skiing.   new terrain that was just opened this year is great, but leaves you wanting more.  If you are looking for open bowl skiing or hike to terrain, DMR isn't for you, though you certainly could mix in a day with one of the local cat skiing operations to satisfy the need.

It is also worth noting that the town and ski area are about 30 minutes away from each other.  While this is a drawback I certainly wouldn't say it is a deterrent.",runner/skier
7237,2010-02-26,Vermont,Stratton Mountain,5,"Stratton's been around a long time, it's nice to see the management keep it up to date by taking good care of good mountain. y do several things well here that are very important to eastern skiing: make quality & quantity of snow, have the expertise to groom it and keep it in shape, have several speedy lifts that place the crowds all over the mountain.  terrain has never been super challenging, but the addition of lots of new glades has substantially added some great new areas to explore and make a big difference, of course, they're only open when there's enough natural snow. y advertise a 2,000' vertical and here you really get it with several lifts providing access to the top with many choices of runs bringing you to the bottom, unlike some places that advertise that but only by taking measurements that don't really relate to the terrain as it's laid out   you know places where the runs just don't flow into to each other to get the vertical and you have take different lifts, traverses to try to get it, not here thankfully. As I stated in pros/cons, being easily accessible from NYC/Boston metro areas is a blessing and curse, so try to go off days to avoid crowds.  handsome new village area has made the base area much more attractive, with some great accomodations, dining options, shops, and charming Manchester is just down the road.

7245,2010-02-27,Vermont,Magic Mountain Vermont,4,"It takes the right kind of skier/rider to love Magic Mountain. This is my second winter with a season pass to magic and my 3 season since first trying it.  I love this mountain and have little to no desire to return to the bigger, super  ski s.  I personally think the west side of Magic has the best terrain around: full of steeps, bumps, and powder, on beautiful narrow trails that cut through the woods with marvelous view of southern VT.   east side has some great groomed trails for learning or carving on all day long.  Due to some fund raising, they have increased their snow making capacity this year to levels unseen in years past.  So don't let those older reviews scare you.  With that said, Magic still offers very natural terrain and marked trails that will never see the likes of a groomer or snow maker.  So the mountain skis the best during strong seasons and good powder days. 

 people are all friendly and the instructors have all skied magic for years.  y have opened a tubing park for the kids that runs until after the lifts close.   bar / upper lodge is open to everyone after the lifts close and hosts live music that both kids and adults enjoy.  

If you are looking for classic skiing without the lines, prices, or corporate run feeling of the other mountains, you may want to give magic a try.  Or for that matter, next time you are at Bromley, Stratton or Okemo, ask your instructor, lift operator, or ski patrol what they think of Magic, they all ski Magic when the snow is good.  

I give this an overall rating of 5 stars based on skiing only, not on  style amenities.  Magic provides you with all that you need for a great day of skiing/riding and little more.   Red lift is an old school double that takes 13 minutes to get to the top   which means you can only get in about 20 runs in a full day     this is  mixed blessing, the limited capacity to get you up the slopes means less runs for everyone, but it also means no crowded trails.  If you are from out of town and up for a week, I'd recommend stopping by for a day to check it out.  As you see from the other reviews: you will either love it or hate it ... there is no indifference when it comes to magic, you just have to see for yourself.  ",R Lee Stump

7259,2010-03-01,Pennsylvania,Elk Mountain Ski,5,"So here is the deal with Elk Mountain.. I have skied there five times in 2010. This was my first year there. Full disclosure, I  have been skiing for about 35 years. However due to an injury and middle age I no longer am searching for challenges that might wreck my body. But I can enjoy most any novice and intermediate run. It's fine by me to just be out there. I have no aspirations to be the next Bodee Miller. However I do have certain things I am looking for when I hit a . 1 I hate crowds. 2 I hate snow boarders (get off my snow, jerk). y don't have enough control for my liking ,so stay away from me. 3 I like slow lifts. I need a couple of minutes for my legs to recouperate before my next run. I don't need to be beamed up to the top of the mountain at warp speed. 4 I want an area that can take care of the snow and groom it properly. I want courderoy snow, not Mad River Glen raw, uneven, ""natural"" conditions.If I want natural I will go out west. I wan't man made, phony eastern snow, groomed to perfection.  Also I don't need night life for a day trip to PA (I would not go to any part of PA for night life anyway, thank you very much). So yes, I am a snotty arrogant old @#$% skier who is set in his way, and is not going to compromise. I have skied at the following hills in the east: Okemo,Stratton, Whiteface, Pico, Butternut, Windham and Platekill (yucch to Platekill, by the way, what an over rated dump). Of all those places Elk gives me more of what I want. 
Elk Mountain is not the biggest area in the east, but they make the most of their 1000 foot vertical, and it is big enough and varied enough so you won't be bored. 
 crowds are non existent on week days  which is the best time to go. Saturday is another story, forget about it, particularly in the afternoon. But Sunday isn't too bad.  lift lines were only bad on Saturday PM. Also while there are boarders here, this is not a snow boarders mountain so there weren't too many.
 grooming is very good (maybe second behind Okemo in my book). and I  found the conditions were consistently very good.  Much better than you might expect from an old timey area.
 lodge is attractive but outdated.  stairs going down to the locker rooms and bathroom are ridiculously narrow and you feel like you are going to kill yourself with your ski boots on. Come on guys, this is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  seating in the cafeteria is very elementary school. Fixed stools attached to tables with no back. Very uncomfortable unless you go to the childrens ski school area in the lodge where you will be asked to leave. y at least have benches there. re is a bar and restaraunt that is nicer, but you can't hang out there unless you are drinking or being served a meal. y could also use some outside chairs for sunny days. But fix the stairs please. 
and lets talk about the lifts. Everyone hates em, not me. I LOVE EM. y are all fixed grips slow yes, but they don't get stuck and they suit me fine. Some of the lift operaters were a little dopey.For instance the uloading area on the main double (Lift B ) had insufficient snow at the top one day. So the operator was shoveling in between people unloading. I fell getting off. Hey dummy, stop the lift for two minutes, shovel and pat down the snow and then turn the lift back on, it ain't rocket science. Also I loaded by myself on the quad and the operator never told me to get over to the middle and the lift rocked and hit the first tower. Dumb stuff that an attentive operator should be watching out for. 
But all in all, even with my complaints, I think I found my new ski home. A relaible and nice experience.

7262,2010-03-01,Colorado,Aspen Snowmass,5,"It is possible to ski cheaply here if you are willing to completely sacrifice on comfort and if you are willing to give up first chair for turns that might start around 10:30. If you can stand sleeping in your car, and then buying a lift ticket for $20 from some Texan who's all skied out by 11 AM, then you can have a lot of fun here. Now, I'm not suggesting that you do this, but keep the idea in mind because you will be shocked when you see the price on everything in this town. Look to pay next to double on everything from gas to top ramen. Lift tickets don't come cheap either. But, you do get a lot for your money. Best bet is to completely skip aspen and either opt for highlands or jaunt on over to Snowmass. If it is Highlands, you are doing it for the bowl, and that's about it. This is definitely something every skier should do in his or her lifetime, so do it now while you are here. After that, stay in Snowmass. That is where the terrain challenge is. 

 real estate maze gets a little old in Snowmass after everything is said and done, so after your legs are done for the day, go back to Aspen where the nightlife is. This is really a great ski town, and it is quite ritzy. In the tradition of Sun Valley, Telluride, and Crested Butte, this is a town that was here well before the ski area came along, so you have some great old architecture and a really centalized feel to everything, unlike the weird drive by feel you have in the interstate s like Vail.

7263,2010-03-01,Massachusetts,Ski Butternut,4,"Went to Butternut today after it was suggested to us by a couple of friends.  I was very reluctant to go as I usually like to go to the Bigger Mountains in VT.  MY wife insisted after finding out about the Girl Scout Discounts!  It only cost us 35.00 per person on a holiday week!   We had a blast skiing in the 8"" of new powder all day.  It was great.  I really liked the Terrain parks both the begginer and the bigger one.  I think we will all be getting season passes next year at under 300.00 for the pass Who can go wrong.  This will be the place for us to ski from now on.

7266,2010-03-01,Vermont,Smugglers' Notch,4,"i've been to smuggs three times. never been on MORSE (beginner slopes). been on a majority of the trails on STERLING and MADONNA. first time was not good. they groomed. it froze solid. it didn't soften up that day. came back later that spring and did FreeFall, on the best day of the year for that trail (according to my ski patrol buddy). exposed rock, grass, other stuff sticking out of the snow, but definitely able to be skied. loved it. FINALLY, went this past january after the big storm in burlington. 18 inches of fresh pow on the trails and knee plus deep in the trees. had a really good day. the weather can drastically affect the mountain's conditions...dress appropriately and go.
MADONNA has the toughest terrain (black/double black) in the east i've seen or been on so far. the trails are tough and even when the conditions are great, trails can still be gnarly. it will push you and challenge your skiing or riding. and then someone will come by you and make the trail you're on look like a green circle that's been freshly groomed. 
i would really recommend to anyone thinking about poaching trails at this mountain (madonna)    think about it three or four times. if the trail is closed on this mountain, ski patrol REALLY has a reason for it. if you have to do a few more runs, or wait a few weeks, do it. and even when it does open, it doesn't mean it will be great. or even good. any trail from the top of madonna that is open could still be NASTY. some of these trails can become really nasty after only a couple of skiers and riders. expect hard conditions and to be challenged, and go. 
 GLADES are good, real good. smuggs has a solid progression for learning to ski/ride in the trees leading up to their super duper triple black diamond glade,  Black Hole. they are spread out all over STERLING and MADONNA. like others have said, most skiers and riders here better than at a lot of other s. and most ski the trees, so expect to see people in the trees. don't worry, smuggs has plenty.
FAMILY MOUNTAIN    i think they are considered the definition of family mountain from everything i've heard/seen.
TERRAIN PARK    the park i remember is a PROFESSIONAL park. MASSIVE, Olympic style features. for those of us a little less talented/experienced, i didn't see anything    could be on MORSE?
LIFTS & LINES    slow and slower; can't handle it, go somewhere else...

7267,2010-03-02,Wyoming,Grand Targhee,4,"re are so many good things to say about this hill, chief among them being one of the most perfect combinations of snowfall and terrain that you will find in the states.  ""wet"" side of the Tetons consistently gets more snow than the ""dry"" Jackson Hole side. It's not uncommon to see the Ghee posting up much higher overnight depth ratings during storms than Jackson Hole, despite their relative proximity. 

 terrain here is great too, good long blue cruisers and plenty of steep, hike to and sidecountry. re is somewhat of a lack of steep, lift accessed terrain, but don't stay away because of that.

 price of a lift ticket is great too, especially considering you won't be spending too much time in line, if you do at all. You'll have five figures in vertical by noon, no problem. 

However, if you are looking for afluent shopping and dining, stay away from here. This place is not for trust fund babies. Targhee is unpretentious and for skiers and families that love the sport, not the glitz. If you can't stand the thought of drinking cheap beer instead of some flirtini, you best kick it on over to the other side of the Tetons, because you won't find that here. ",bluemoon1975

If you are looking for some great nightlife I wouldn't expect anything great turning up here. Personally I would take the advantage of doing night skiing since the area doesn't have much to offer.

But, on the other hand, Liberty does have some nice trails, especially for beginners, their green trail like Sneaky Pete is good for someone to learn on. y also have some nice moguls in 2 places for you to try out.

7287,2010-03-03,Pennsylvania,Montage Mountain,3,"I’ll start out by giving some trivia which should set the stage. SnoMountian is located on a road named Montage Mountain Road (the  used to be called Montage, but I refuse to call it Sno least it be confused with Mt. Snow in Vermont.) and Montage Mountain Road is actually on Moosic Mountain, but I suppose “Moosic Mountain Ski Area” wasn’t flashy enough in the early ‘80s when the  opened. se facts support my belief that no matter who runs the place, or what they choose to call it, one should beware of the marketing department.

I was a regular skier here from 1992 1999. This was essentially my home mountain and I skied there 2 3 times a week because of it’s proximity to my home and the ridiculously low lift ticket prices there when the  was run by Lackawanna County. (You truly do get what you pay for.) A few years ago, around 2006, the county sold the  to a private company and every skier in the area quietly rejoiced in the hope that someone with actual experience would now be running the place. In the past, lift attendants were rumored to be minor offenders serving community service time and it was widely alleged that the managers got their jobs due to who they know in the country courthouse. Things have not gotten much better.

On my last trip there in January 2010, lift attendants were smoking while loading, and were seen texting on their phones while loading as well. I voiced my concern about that to one of their on snow “Skier Awareness Team” members (basically wanna be patrollers who probably can’t pass the NSP medical tests) and they said they would look into it. Not more than 30 seconds later one of the “Safety Team” members flew by me on a snowboard so quickly and so close, I could have easily slammed the buffoon with my arm. “Safety Team” my sweet $%&*##! 

 new management team did install a bunch of new snowmaking machinery and to their credit, has put it to good use. In the ‘90s, at least 3 4 slopes would regularly go without snowmaking the entire season. Since I moved back to the area and started skiing there 2 3 times a year I have to say that trails I hadn’t seen snow in since the Blizzard of ’93 were once again open and groomed. Likewise, additional connectors and a gladed area had been added to terrain that had a reputation for being bare.

Unfortunately, the overall conditions at Sno have not changed.  top portions of the mountain tend to be icy at night and can range from icy to slushy during the day.  western facing mountain takes a lot of sun during the day and can get really sloppy until sunset, then the temperature drop and skier use turns it to boilerplate by 6:30pm.  lower portion of the , where the expert runs are, will tend to stay soft and ice free most of the day and into the evening as well. 

Two or three hours are all any expert skier needs to spend at Sno.  lower trails, Cannonball, Smoke, and Boomer are all excellent runs and Lower Fast Track and Lower Runaway can also be fun excursions.  coup de gras is White Lightning. It is a short, but steep run almost always bumped up and it can tend to be icy because lots of people who shouldn’t be on bumps still try to ride it. To its credit, if it were longer, it would be more difficult than Killington’s Outer Limits. 

 cafeteria is overpriced, the gift shop is under stocked and overpriced, and the staff is less than professional. A friend of mine went to inquire at Skier Services about an upcoming deal Sno was offering. He had a copy of the flyer with some information and the girl at the counter stated she had no idea about what he was asking about and no one there had any other information. Another similarly Hollister clad teen queen was working the cafeteria register and had difficulty ringing up my chicken fingers and fries. I attempted to give her the odd change needed so she could give me back two quarters in change. This perplexed her, but she giggled at her poor mathematical skills. Awww…how cute.

 ski school is either inept or my buddy’s girlfriend really is the moron he claims she is because she’s taken at least five lessons over the past two years and still can’t get down the easy slopes in under 40 minutes. 

Overall, if you are driving to SnoMountain from the south, just stay on I 81 North for a few more miles and take the exit for Elk Mountain. Save yourself some grief and skip on Sno. If you are a local, it’s an OK place for a few hours, every couple of weeks, but becomes old hat very quickly. Of course, if there is a blinding snow storm all bets are off and the terrain can be really great, so you won’t mind the second hand smoke from the liftie as you wait to get on the chair.",ryanscottmac

Rustler lift should be operating more to keep the better skiers on the upper runs.  Its a pain to have to ski the lower easy runs just to get back up to the harder runs.   green runs should be groomed ALL the time for the whole season. A real  grooms all the green runs every night and all day if snowing.  Beginners don't like powder days.  My family was so mad the green runs had about 6 inches of powder on them the whole day.   Cyclone lift is way to long and sitting on slats is not very comfortable  should be high speed.  re used to be padding on the chairs but for some reason they took the pads off.  Getting from Sunrise Mountain to the other 2 Mountains is quite difficult for beginner skiers even though the runs are green runs  they're very skinny.  Maybe a lift from Apache base to Sunrise Mountain would be great.  Lodges seriously need an upgrade.

7339,2010-03-08,Pennsylvania,Camelback Mountain,3,"We have been going to this mountain for 2 years as a home mountain.  It is most likely the best in the Poconos, but only for a few reasons.  One of these is that it is close by to our home (about 1 hour).  We have been to all the other mountains in this area, and other than Blue Mountain, it is the only game in town.  If you or your family are ""first time on skis"" folks, Shawnee or Alpine are much better mountains, as you will find crowds at Camelback (especially on the weekends).  This place has a few decent runs in the middle of the mountain (Hump, Marjie's, Asp, Rocket), paired with some interesting terrain on the other end of the hill (Nile Mile, Cliffhanger, Pharaoh, Pocono Raceway).   middle of the mountain requires a 10 dollar fee to ride the ""Park"" trails, which don't look all that great.  BIGGEST CON IS THE NEW MANAGEMENT.  y are trying to squeeze every dollar out of the people that go to this mountain.  This is not a good thing for those of us that use this hill as a place to improve and retain skills in order to ride other, bigger, more destination oriented mountains that we don't happen to live close to.

 Dangerous Conditions (NO SNOWMAKING+NO GROOMING=SHEER ICE FACE and LITTLE BUMPS AT BOTTOM OF STEEP PITCHES!!!!!!)

It was a warm day, so it was understandable that some parts of the hill had no snow, which wasn't good maintenance on their part, but understandable I suppose. y didn't turn the snow machines on during the day, which may have fixed that. 

This is a good place to learn how to ski, as the main hill isn't that crowded. However, you get what you pay for, as there is only one hill. It got really ice in the evening though, so I wouldn't recommend night skiing. Went with some beginners and newbies and everyone pretty much got to the green slopes towards the end of the day which was encouraging.  food is okay, the bathrooms are dirty, but this isn't a bad place to learn overall. 

Some of the chairlifts are really tricky to slide off of and it got progressively worse and icy as the day went on. 

I wouldn't bring my own ski's here at all, as they will probably get damaged. 

Rental shop is efficient though lines tend to build up. re is plenty of staff though so we didn't wait too long. 

ir snow patrol is also very efficient and friendly and they helped my friends get up a bunch of times when they fell.  staff is friendly, the places could be better maintained, but its cheap and decent place to learn how to ski. ",powhound820
7341,2010-03-08,Pennsylvania,Shawnee Mountain,3,"I was skiiing at Shawnee on January 23, 2010.  This was my second time skiing at Shawnee.  I do not understand all of the advertisements for Shawnee advertising that it is for beginners.  I generally ski about 12 times a year on mostly intermediate and advanced trails.  I would not recommend Shawnee for beginners.   trails are steep and sometimes narrow.   worst part of the trails is that they converge in certain areas making these areas very dangerous even for the experienced skier.   end of the trails are the most difficult because of the steepness and congestion which would be difficult for a beginner skier.   trails that they label as beginner I feel should be labeled as intermediate.",powhound820
7342,2010-03-08,Maine,Shawnee Mountain,4,"Great value for short bucks.  Although only 15 miles from North Conway, it takes a full 30 minutes drive to get there.  Skied Sunday afternoon for only $27.  It was 5 days after a rain storm, little or no new snow since, but the surface was adequate   I didn't lose an edge all afternoon.  Skies bigger than it's vertical would suggest.  Very few skiers on the East side.  Lift lines weren't bad on a sunny, comfortable Sunday; up to 10 minutes at the West base, non existent at the East base.  However there is no high speed lift.  Has some steep trails but few dips, banks and rolls which would make them more fun.  Because of the snow conditions, I didn't ski any glades.  

 view from some of the East side trails looked like you were about to ski into the big lake below   awesome.  

If everyone in your party can ski intermediate trails, consider parking at the East lodge.  I saw open parking spaces within 100 feet of the lift (which is just steps away from the lodge).  Not as many food and drink options as the West (main) lodge though.  ",runner/skier
7346,2010-03-09,Colorado,Wolf Creek,5,"Just left Wolf Creek and my buds and I loved every minute.  We were surprised right off the bat by plenty of fresh powder, even though we had been watching the weather and none was forecast.  We had fresh every day for 3 days.  No wind, temps in low 30's.  Great base meant great tree skiing and Wolf Creek has oodles of it.  Made a couple of hikes up to Alberta Peak and another ridge and had fresh tracks in knee deep!

I did not rate this mountain for family, terrain park or nightlife because I was not there for a family trip, don't care about terrain parks and knew in advance that it is not a full service , i.e. nightlife.

FYI, this is a skiers mountain.  No frills.  It is located at the top of Wolf Creek Pass with a base elevation of about 10,000 feet.  re is no lodging.  re are no restaraunts, etc.  re is a basic base lodge with cafeteria with bar.

We stayed in town here for 5 nights but only skied one day.  (We did 4 day trips to other s nearby, because the lift tickets were also good at Keystone, A Basin, Vail, and Beaver Creek).

7353,2010-03-10,New York,Gore Mountain,2,"We spend the Dec 24 2009 through Jan 4 2010 in the area and spent most days at Gore.  We love it there.  My kids have participated in their kids programs and have not only enjoyed it, but have been well taught by enthusiastic teachers who go the extra mile.  I like the variety of terrain and the large number of choices for someone of my skill level (intermediate/snowboarding).  We love especially that almost everyone there is relatively local, or appreciates and respects the local flavor of the ... so no 'attitude' and few Type As running around.

What I have learned from two seasons now is that conditions are very, very tough if the weather isn't 'just right.'   last couple of weeks were good examples.  Windy and cold conditions blew most of the top layer of powder/snow off large parts of the mountain leaving a very icy (not hardpack powder, but clear, glassy ice) conditions exposed.  When you have a 9 yr old boy who lives for snowboarding, and he stops you on the mountain at 11am and says, ""Dad I think we should go home, this is just too dangerous,"" you know you're not having the fun you paid for.  and he was right   and we left after only two runs.  Expensive mistake.

What I love about Gore is that it's one of the most interesting and enjoyable places to ride/ski in the area, but you have to hit it on just the right days with the right conditions.  I wish the reports would be more 'honest' about the icy patches because they are expansive and unavoidable and dangerous.   number of lifts and trails open also posted on the Gore web site have not been right all year... some of my favorite runs and lifts are showing 'open' when they are not.

Other than very touchy conditions, I can wholeheartedly endorse their Kids Club program and school   and if you want your kids to have a great time learning or improving their skills, this is the place to go   we've been to many, many others and have returned to Gore for a second season BECAUSE of their kids program.

7358,2010-03-10,North Carolina,Appalachian Ski Mountain,3,"I really hate reading all these reviews that talk about how small and expensive app ski mountain is. I have been frequenting app ski for years and now I live close enough to walk there. Yes its small, we're in NC for goodness sake. and yes it can get crowded, as can any mountain when the snow is great and everyone is off for a holiday. I will stand by the fact that app ski is the best place to learn.  terrain parks that app ski has to offer is exactly why you see more snowboarders and people on the ground. Lucky for everyone else skiing or snowboarding, all the terrain parks are off to the sides and have their own designated entries and exits.

I have been to Snowshoe and Holiday Valley on the east coast and was in Charlotte for a week and two days so I decided to see what Sugar Mountain was all about.  website described the snow conditions on the mountain as packed powder and frozen granular...only problem is, they failed to state all the HUGE patches of ice, not just in the middle of EVERY run but  even on the edges, even on the black diamonds and the double diamond.  ONLY run that had decent powder was an illegal run that follows the top lift down. What makes it illegal?...they don't let people on that run because the lifts present a hazard...like the 2 thousand trees around the runs aren't a hazard. After 45min of boarding on this hill they call a mountain, I went to try and get a refund since the website was clearly wrong about the conditions stated on the website but the girl working the counter said they have a strict no refund policy...its obvious why, they knew the conditions on the hill and they didn't want people to know, otherwise that would hurt their profits...well sugar mountain lift, you'll never get me suckered again, I'll never return here and hopefully if anyone reads this, they will save their time and money and skip this sad sad excuse for a lift.

7393,2010-03-13,Utah,Snowbird,5,"I have been to Solitude, Brighton, Alta, Snowbird,  Canyons, Park City Mountain, and Deer Valley.

 terrain found in Little Cottonwood Canyon at Snowbird is my favorite of any of the places listed above.  most difficult terrain is very easily accessed, and requires little work.

Lift lines are reasonable for a place of such popularity. Little Cloud can become a little congested at times.  

General canyon advice   wake up early on big snow days because there is a line forming to get in to Little Cottonwood Canyon by 8:30 A.M. If you have a 2wd vehicle and it is 4x4 or chains required, you can ride a bus up for $3.50 one way, although the Park & Ride lots can be pretty busy, so plan this out beforehand.

 Mineral Basin area is the only area of its kind at any of the places I have been to. I can't give out any more information on the goods beyond that. But for those determined, Snowbird offers everything a skier has come to look for.

If you are a beginner don't be discouraged by the praise of Snowbird's difficult terrain. Snowbird pretty much dedicates the whole Baby Thunder lift to still aspiring skiers. Although to be fair, none of the Big Cottonwood Canyon or Little Cottonwood Canyon ski areas have the endless selection of easy groomers that the Park City area s have.

7395,2010-03-14,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,4,"I just came back from what the locals have been calling epic conditions at Snowshoe.  My friend and I were there for 2 days and over 2 feet of fresh powder fell during that time.  We had a haul to get there but were pleased to find that by arriving mid week, there were hardly any lines for the lifts and the runs did not disappoint.  I have skied several of the big s out west and the conditions at Snowshoe this year would rival anything out west.  Night skiing was good at Silver Creek   the runs have good lighting and the shuttle is the best way to go since they are constantly running.

 only negative about Snowshoe are there is no cell reception for Verizon and spotty reception for AT&T around the mountain unless you hit a Wi Fi hotspot.  We didn't find out about this until we started up the mountain and found it to be a major inconvenience since we all live and die by our cells phones these days.

7404,2010-03-15,New Mexico,Ski Santa Fe,2,"Looks like this year all the New Mexico ski areas are rocking with snow and it is all great skiing.  Santa Fe is a great mountain when the base gets above 55 inches.  Right now the base is well above 55"" and the ridge is open if you hike it and so is the Big Tesuque (not in the ski area boundary).   terrain has several advanced to expert runs, they just are not that long.  Most of the time the ski area is not that congested, but on certain weekends it can be a wait on lower mountain, but not too bad once you get to the mid mountain lifts.

When it comes to customer service, Ski Santa Fe has very poor performance.  Some (though certainly not all)of the lift operators can be very rude and the same is true for the skier services department.   owner himself can be really ugly and rude.  Do yourself a favor and get a map, then ask one of the local skiers for help or directions.

Finally, Santa Fe is loaded with great restuarants and grocery stores and numerous health stores.  Do yourself another favor and take up your lunch and/or eat out in town.   ski area food is overpriced and not very good.

7414,2010-03-16,New York,Whiteface Mountain,5,"Whiteface is known as a skiers mountain and nearby Lake Placid is a great ski town

Whiteface is a unique ski mountain.  very things that make it great have a flip side which can make it not so great. Whiteface is a big mountain by eastern standards. It has the most vertical of any lift served mountain in the East. and it has some of the best skiing to be had anywhere when the conditions are right. When conditions are bad, it can be very dangerous to the unwary.    Whiteface is owned by the State of New York and located in the Adirondack Park in which development is severely limited in a heavy handed fashion by the APA (Adirondack Park Agency).  As such Whiteface is unlikely be fully expanded to it's potential for trail development or slope side or base lodging. This creates the paradox the mountain being a forever locals mountain versus commercial and crowded. Management is selected based on politics and the core base of employees are long term State employees who do a pretty decent job of shedding the ""state worker"" mentality, but this explanation will help the visitor make sense of why the parking lot attendants are rude and act like you are a problem rather than a customer.  management style is rather ""what is convenient for the managers and employees, got a problem with that?"" For example, many s will do  mid day grooming. Not here. Also there is a small army of free loaders wearing orange and yellow jackets  the management has foolishly and erroneously taken on as volunteers. ir only interest is free lift tickets for themselves and their families in exchange for minimally fulfilling some required obligation such as being rude and overbearing parking lot attendants. Plus the early arriving employees are allowed to take the closer parking relegating the customers to the further away parking. Yet the sister  Gore, also owned by the NY State has the employees park remotely and shuttles them in. Gore also has parking lot signs rather than rude attendants.  I guess if I was doing a job better accomplished by a sign, I might be rude and surly too.,  In exchange there are few lift lines, small crowds except vacation high times, and some really great skiing. 

 Skiing:
  You will see a lot of very good skiers at Whiteface. Whiteface tends to develop expert skiers who aspire to ski the most challenging terrain offered.  majority of the skiers you see are experts, racers, former racers, racing coaches, or just really good dedicated skiers.  When I ski at western s and New England s I feel like a standout  skier. at Whiteface I am merely average. 
Beginners and intermediates learn at and enjoy Whiteface too. But it is the least likely place to become a ""terminal intermediate"".  terrain and the other skiers temp learning skiers up to the next step. Most of the really good skiers you see got that way at Whiteface.   typical Whiteface skier will adopt a favorite trail and might happily ski the same trail all day. But for people who  like to explore a different trail every run, you might like a spread out mountain like Killington, VT better. So the very thing some skiers love is a turn off to others. re is an old saying ""If you can ski every trail on Whiteface, you can ski anywhere in the world"". While that saying has merit, it was lessened in preparation for the 1980 Olympics. Stumps and rocks were blasted and covered by countless loads of hay helicoptered up. Snow making was expanded to the entire mountain, lifts were upgraded, the trail widened, and almost the entire mountain can now be groomed. An intermediate run from the top was made allowing for a summit to base intermediate run. Although that is a blue trail at Whiteface, many mountains would mark it expert.  variable conditions can also change this run and the entire mountain from one range of difficulty to another. Another area on the mountain has been opened with a new lift and several new trails cut.  snow making is really good and capable when the management lets them go at it.  flip side is much of the snow making is happening while you are skiing and that can be noisy, cold and wet. Every have a wet snow gun aimed toward the lift to glaze your clothes and ski bottoms? While it's not necessarily an everyday experience at W'face it happens, and no apologies should be expected. 

Lodge food and beverage.

Whiteface has a huge base lodge! It has seen improvements to give it more of a lodge feel. If you have a lot of people and gear you should drive into the unloading/loading area to drop your gear, then park your car in one of the outer lots or pay extra for the closer in parking. If you plan on going back and forth to the car very much this might make sense. 

re is a ski equipment rental, ski  school desk, a food court, a coffee shop, a ski shop, a huge bar upstairs, lockers and more in the lodge.

Midstation is the only other place to go inside and get food and beverages.  location is ideal.   crowd there flows like on a working schedule, coffee break at 10 am, lunch at noon, and another mid afternoon coffee break.  re is the normal average cheeseburger, fries, chili, soup ect available upstairs at the normal high ski lodge rates wherein you are paying for location. re is also a nicer restaurant downstairs the offers better food with more comfortable seating, less hustle and bustle, and a much nicer atmosphere. In fact for the price of a cheeseburger and fries upstairs, you can usually get a very excellent special of the day.


 area around Whiteface. 
 Whiteface does not have a base village. re is NO lodging right at the ! Although it is located in Wilmington, NY, Lake Placid is where most of the lodging and restaurants are. Lake Placid deservedly gets the attention as a premier ski town that is great for families, singles and groups alike. This is much to the chagrin of the closest town of Wilmington which despite marketing efforts is unable to cash in on what they feel is there share of tourist related business. re used to be a clever ad on the radio chanting ""turn left"", ""turn left"". and indeed turning left as you leave the mountain brings you to some very great restaurants and bars in Wilmington.  at the same time there is an old joke saying they roll up the streets in Wilmington at 8:30 pm. That reflects the truism there is great apres ski activity in Wilmington but little or no later night activity. But for those wanting to be as close as possible to the action should check out the offerings in Wilmington.  I know they exist but can't personally give any feedback on motels, inns, or B&B's in Wilmington, but I can tell you Steinhoff's Sportsman Inn is famous for their ""small order of french fries"" which fills a dinner plate. A large order is enough for a group of six. I've eaten dinner there many times and always had good food and service.  atmosphere is casual and there is a mix of those dressed in ski togs coming from skiing and those coming from work, many from the mountain and this is the direction that that most of the non skiing employees reside as well as many of the skiing employees.  other 3/4 turn right.
Lake Placid is a review all in itself. re are many alternative outdoor athletic activities available such as skating, x country skiing, mountaineering skiing, back country skiing. re are too many restaurants and pubs to count and a huge variety of lodging.  main street offers shopping galore.

7415,2010-03-16,Pennsylvania,Whitetail,2,"Went to Whitetail on Wednesday, March 3 with a friend and her two children. We had had some rain the day before but I thought temps would be low enough to still have decent conditions. I was very wrong. Except for a few small patches, the snow was thick slush. I could count on one hand the times my edges found solid footing.  intermediate trails were terrible  very difficult to turn when you had some speed.  black diamonds were OK up top, but turned slushy towards the bottom. We ended up on the green slopes in the afternoon because it was kinda fun since turning wasn't such a challenge without as much speed. 

Now, the conditions can't be blamed on the . It is what it is and I remember some reviewers complaining about the southeastern exposure. Perhaps that's what it was. It hasn't really been that warm so far (low 40's a few days) so I was expecting better conditions.

Well, we waited 2.5 hours to get our skis rented from the time we entered the rental area to the time we received our boots, skis and poles.   place was complete chaois with no system in place to handle the crowd of people renters.  When I asked a manager why it took so long, he only responded that if you checked the website, it would have said to get here at 8 am.  Hardly apologetic.  n, when another patron angrily asked why it had taken 2 hours to get his snow board, he was met with hostility by a clerk who challenged him to a fight in the parking lot.   animals who run this place should all be fired and an investigation into this scam should be looked at by the appropriate authoritites.

7418,2010-03-16,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,5,"My family and friends make  2 or 3 trips to Blue every year.  I will admit that I have only skied a couple of other PA places (Shawnee and Jack Frost) but Blue outranks them by far!  I'm not sure what some other reviewers were talking about with long waits in lift lines.   only time I have ever had to wait any real length of time was the first year we went, which was on Pres Day weekend.  I can honestly say we will NEVER go there again on that weekend.  Blue has a great school hill at the top lodge for beginners as well as a school hill at the lower lodge.  We typically go to the top lodge as it is quite a bit nicer in comparison to the bottom lodge. I think that some of the intermediatte slopes are easier than the ""easy"" Burma road.  Burma is the natural slope beginners gravitate to because it is right off of the main school hill.  It isnt as wide as the easy ""Paradise"" slope and is usually more crowded.  Unlike other reviewers I have seen ski patrol ticket and pull skiers and snowboarders who were going too fast and reckless on the beginner slopes.  Unlike Jack Frost, the runs are long enough that you dont feel you stand in lift lines more than you are actually skiing.   y have always been very accomodating to our group.  y allow us to keep our rentals for 2 days so that on our second day of skiing we dont have to go to the rental process again.   I do think out of control snowboarders are an issue.  When the beginners in our group were learning to ski, they were very wary of the snowboarders.   first year we were there I think there was a real problem with groups of snowboarders just sitting in the middle of some of the runs.  In the 3 years since, I havent seen too much of it.  To combat the high food prices, we always take sandwiches and drinks with us, though they are cracking down on large coolers this year.  We just take smaller coolers now.  My kids do have to get at least one order of french fries though because they are the best!  We love this place and will continue to visit it every year.

If you complete the program (3 visits), they deduct what you have invested from your season pass, should you chose to purchase.....THAT is where they got me, and it is now my ""home"" mountain.  I have since been to several larger, more challanging mountains, but can truly appreciate Greek for what it is; a smaller (and I have been to MUCH smaller), very family friendly .  re is a variety of terrain and trails, and something for all types of skiers and levels.  If you like extremely challanging double blacks, glades (only a few), or forever long runs, Greek may not be for you.  y are, however a GREAT practice mountain (due to the large variety of trails and terrain), and a great place to take the family.  Also, unlike most other s, Greeks full day pass DOES include night skiing, so on a weekend you can ski from 8:30am to 10pm for one price.  ir lifts are definitely old (soon to be upgraded), but not extremely slow and they keep the lines moving very well.  Overall, a fun place to ski with some of the friendliest staff and customers that I have encountered to date.",brian watts
7444,2010-03-17,New York,Woods Valley,5,"I was told by a friend to take my kids to Woods Valley and was not steered wrong. Very easy slopes for the kids. Trails seem longer than Snow Ridge. One very nice thing they've done is to place benches at the bottom and top of the main chair.  snowboarders seem to appreciate that they are not having to sit down on snow around the lifts and it was nice not to have them glogging up the tops of trails sitting on the snow. I wish my local areas   Dry Hill and Snow Ridge would catch on to this and do the same. 
I wish more of the hill was lit for night skiing. Once the lights came on the amount of terrain was cut quite a bit.
Overall, a very nice place to take the kids   probably a good place to learn as well   just judging by the terrain and the special learning area that is nicely off to the side.",conboc

7447,2010-03-17,Washington,Summit at Snoqualmie,4,usually make the extra drive to ride @ baker or stevens and now i remember why!!! Got a late start on monday morning so decided to head to snoqualmie bc its closer for me. FIrst of all when we got there the systems were down so they couldnt even sell us a lift ticket. waited around for about 45 mins and when we asked the lady for some kind of comp she was so rude and obviously didnt care that we had been waiting!!! Second of all i think its ridiculous that i had to pay $60 for my lift ticket (same price as weekend rates)  even though only 1 of the 4 base areas were open bc of it being a weekday!!! So frustrated and will probably never come here again!!! ,Daniel Morris
7450,2010-03-17,New Mexico,Taos Ski Valley,5,"Do not be dissuaded from skiing taos with kids.  You will hear not to frequently, and its just not true. Small kids ski steeper blues easier because of their low center of gravity.  You will see small kids all over Taos slopes, with ski school and with their parents.      ski school is probably the best there is and takes kids all over the mountain on interesting green and blue terrain, the kids will have fun and learn a lot.   You will not see as many very small kids (3 6) skiing thru moguls anywhere else!  Just put them in ski school and they will learn, and learn well.   For never ever teaching, the Rueggli lift and Strawberry hill are used to prepare them before going up the mountain to Whitefeather.   Your kids will progress at Taos far faster than at most Co s, in my experience.  ",drdevon
7451,2010-03-17,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,4,"I was in Denver for a work meeting  I live on the East Coast. I decided to give one of the ski s a try. It was late April and only A basin and Loveland was open. A basin was a few miles closer so I decided on that. I had only skied mid east mountains  the highest elevation was a little over 4000. What a difference.  view was breathtaking everywhere I looked. Had a couple of inches of fresh snow on the ground. Just incredible.

 I was doing OK on blues out east but got pummeled by the blues at A basin. I've improved a lot since then and am looking forward to trying it again.  trails were awesome  nice and wide for the most part. Even the greens were a lot of fun with turns and twists everywhere. Skiing through the trees was fun. Sking above the treeline was incredible. 

I suspect that if you're a mid east coaster  any  in CO will be worlds better than anything you're used to. A basin is very laid back and cool. A great late season place to go.",drdevon

7481,2010-03-17,Utah,Deer Valley,4,"Let me preface my review by saying this:

Deer Valley is one of the best s in America. It has impecable service, amazing grooming, is very well laid out, has great tree skiing, is whole heartedly geared toward serving families, and always has consistent snowfall.

That being said however, there are some problems. 

First, you are going to pay out the wazoo for this place. Granted, it is very similar in price to comparable s like Aspen or Sun Valley, but personally, I don't like paying for frills, so this is a pretty big negative for those just seeking a thrill.

Second, don't come here if you are a jibber. Park City is right next door, and they cater to that whole heartedly.  TNT terrain park is pretty much geared towrads kids, much like the  is very well catered to families.

Third, the terrain wont take your breath away. You can certainly find a challenge here if you try, especially up top where the crowds thin out, but Snowbird or Alta are going to offer you much more in that arena. 

Finally, this  doesn't allow snowboarders. This has to be the most short sighted decision that could have been made by a  that claims to be catering to families. Taos made the best observation when they decided to open their mountain to snowboarders. y said that they were turning far to many families away who just happened to have one kid or adult that snowboarded. It was bad for business and it didn't really make a whole lot of sense. Granted, snowboarders have two world class choices right next door with the Canyons and especially Park City, but this policy is a stigma from a bygone era. Frankly, I don't even think they should have a legal basis for excluding snowboarders if their lease is primarily on public land, which I imagine it is.  wholefeeling about how snowboarders have bad attitudes is missing the point. It's not snowboarders, its just people, a few people, and they can choose either skis or a snowboard.  method of transportation doesn't define the person. As a skier, I would whole heartedly support forcing the  to open its lifts to snowboarders. This policy is asinine and reeks of stereotyping filth.",Ryan Pringnitz

7511,2010-03-21,Pennsylvania,Liberty,4,"Ski Liberty used to be my go to mountain because it’s real close to DC and has some challenging terrain (for the size of the mountain) and a nice Tavern with lots of drinks and beers on tap – which is handy for warming up during night skiing sessions. 

I typically go skiing at night at Liberty because on the weekends it can be very crowded during the day. and in not so snowy seasons, they run the snowmakers at night so it doesn’t get icy. Giving night skiers a little layer of snow to ski on.

Lately though, it’s been hit or miss. 

Liberty has been getting huge crowds on the weekends that don’t thin out until well after 8:30 p.m. Maybe it’s the Olympics or all the snow we got this season but, there’s just too many people who don’t know what they are doing on narrow, steep trails. It takes a lot of fun out of it. y day we went Ski Patrol had to take at least 3 people off the mountain and called an ambulance for one skier – lots of beginners pushing themselves way past their ability, probably apart of some travel group. Ski Patrol did do a good job of protecting the downed skiers.

That said, I did go to Liberty in December of 2010 and it was nearly empty by nightfall and we had a great time. I say it all depends on the snow conditions and the crowds because there’s three things I do like about Liberty:

1.	 east face has 2 lifts that service about 4 5 blue and black trails. re’s hardly a lift line and you can get in a lot of short leg burning runs. and when you’re ready for a break, Blue Streak a diamond trail on the north side is a straight shot down to the bar.

2.	y have some nice, long flat runs for beginners to learn on.  lifts run smooth and have good ramps and areas for getting off. and it’s separate from the real bunny hill where people are putting on skis for the first time. 

3.	 terrain park is loaded with jumps and rails. It’s a lot of fun, the snow is usually in great condition and nice and hard for getting up speed. I havent’ seen a comparable park this far south. 

Liberty can be fun… but it’s pretty expensive and you never know what you’re going to get. My bet is January and December are the best times to go. February brings in insane crowds. 

y do have a snow guarantee that lasts for a year, so if it's not working out, take your ticket back and get a refund and come back later... the rainchecks also work at Whitetail and Roundtop and they honor them at the ticket windows... they are easy to redeem. ",Al Cipparone

7538,2010-03-23,California,Big Bear,4,"Summit is a family oriented , the mountain terrain is average but I like the variety and length of runs for beginners. Summit Run & Miracle Mile are both wonderful if u want a longer ride with your small kids.  I was able to ride w/ my five yr old without fearing speed demons or reckless jumpers since the staff routinely conduct speed checks & mid run gates keep folks in slow control   thus rest assured they are cognizant of safety.  Parking is a challenge, but the shuttle system will pick u up even if you're a few blocks away, at the end of the day the same shuttle is a welcome blessing.  ticket policy is flexible, since if you don't like conditions within the first hour   u can get a future voucher, but I'd like to see them adopt the Mt. High (debit) points system as an alternative or option to a full day pass.  Our kids tire easily & often like to take breaks between runs, so a points ticket would alleviate the time pressure for parents.  Food is expensive, but not as expensive as eating at a movie   there are ample picnic tables & few outdoor bars.  Summit offers SoCal’s first original halfpipe & some great jibs but the mountain pales in comparison to the features of say, Mammoth or the Nintendo Park @ Blackcomb.  I'm originally from Vancouver (Whistler) so please understand that this SoCal mt.n ""is what it is"", don't expect a CO, BC or UT experience.  Those people who complain about snow quality & ice have unreasonable expectations, the fact is, when it snows at Summit, it’s a whole lotta fun!  We have a mixed family of skiers/riders and unlike the skate rat scene at Bear, the Summit side seems to be more skier friendly (but not to the extent of snobby Deer Valley).  Traffic at the end of the day is a drag so be patient the journey is long, slow & curvy, not the ez gradual drive (like Wrightwood). Also, bring a lock 4 your gear   they post warning signs, so evidently they have a theft problem.  When I head up by myself I usually hit Bear because of the snowboarder centric jibes & terrain park, but if you plan on going up with the whole family (particularly with young children, who prefer to ski) then, I think the better option might be Big Bear.",Jeff Gibson
7550,2010-03-23,Vermont,Killington,5,"This mountain is not as great as everyone would have you believe.  I feel everyone is under the ""Emperors New Clothes"" syndrom.  Everyone else says it's good so it must be good.  If you get there before 8am and take first run you will have great snow.  After 9 you will struggle with skied off conditions and manmade mogels the rest of the day  even on the blue and greens.  se are great if that is what you are looking for but with knee surgery and a pins in my leg from a ski accident a few years back the only place I can comfortable ski after 9 is Ramshead, nice little hill but not worth the premium price.  
My kids ski the woods and the stash but we will not be coming back until they can get a handle on the grooming.  I will leave the mountain for the arrogant SOB's who will tell you they have skied all day but have really only skied in the morning and spent the rest of the day in the lodge.   kids at Killington are just arrogant SOB's in training.  Since I ski alone I spend a lot of time on the lifts with these kids and they are rude and mean.  I can only hope my kids are not like these kids, I would be so embarressed.

I did not see a single ski patrol.  Not much fun for a family of mixed levels.

Beginners, stay on the EZ Rider lift, but you still have to be on the lookout for other ""guest"" racing to the lift lines.  Experts, stay away from the blue trails.  Most of the bombs fizzle on the black trails.",ryanscottmac

7568,2010-03-24,New Hampshire,Bretton Woods,5,"Bretton Woods gives a consistently very good skiing experience.  It's lack of steep terrain and only mid size vertical (1500') may leave expert skiers wanting, but even they can find the area fun.  No major wind problems.   trails keep their snow.  Usually more snow than any other ski area in NH.  4 high speed quads so the only significant lift lines are on Massacusetts school vacation weeks.  Great glades, even for low intermediates.  Not a lot of expert skiers so powder can be found days after a dump.  Expert trails offer only short blasts of steeps, but almost all the trails on the mountain have lots of dips and rolls to keep things fun.  Moguls:  Agassiz and Darby's Drop, otherwise do the glades.  

 views of Mt. Washington and the Presidential range are spectacular.   free ski valet service is a very nice underused feature.  Free hot cider dispensed in the lodge mid morning.  Lift tickets are expensive for NH so look for deals online.   food in the lodge is even more expensive than normal, so bring your lunch.  Aprez ski:  If the lodge doesn't have entertainment to your liking, have a drink at the grand old Mt. Washington Hotel across the street with its spectacular view at the base of the Presidential range.  If you're staying in the North Conway area, the Red Parka Pub in Glen Junction is a popular watering hole with live music on weekends and good food.  ",bostowyo

Solitude is ""it""! I had a pass at Solitude for 6 of the 8 years that I lived in UT and I still make a return trip to ski there every year because it is simply ""it""! All of skidom will tell you that Alta is the place but just ask all the ""Altaholics"" where they go when either Little Cottonwood is closed or it's a weekend powder day and they'll all tell you Solitude. Although there aren't a lot of groomed options at Solitude the ones that are there are interesting and anything but mundane.  advanced terrain is unmatched for a  of this size and if the trail sign has a double diamond then you had better have your skills together or else you may find yourself in big big trouble. One really cool aspect of Solitude is the backcountry access (probe, shovel, beacon and knowledge REQUIRED). When the Highway To Heaven gates are open then the world is your oyster with unlimited untracked lines through some of the sickest terrain you will ever see. Pretty much all of the terrain that is in your line of sight from the gate is easily accessable and there is a return trail from Brighton that will bring you back around to the Solitude base...that reminds me, don't bother with the Solitude Brighton combo ticket, just ski one or the other on any given day and save your money, its just not worth it. Speaking of tickets the  offers a ticket that is good for either 10 or 20 rides that can be spread out over several days making the backcountry options sweeter!  beginer stuff is a little short but it is somewhat separated from the other terrain making it a pleasant environment for novices and families. If you arrive at the  with your ticket already in hand (you can purchase discounted lift tickets at the ski shop at the mouth of Big Cottonwood canyon, next to the 7 11) then you should enter the lower parking lot and go all the way to the right where you can put your skis on and ski down to the quad chair and then at the end of the day you can just catch the Postcard run and ski right back to your car with no walking. If you are staying in the village then you're all set, that is unless you were looking for something to do after skiing. That being said, the Thirsty Squirrel is a fun (but expensive) bar and there is also Molly's up at Brighton (a mile up the road, there used to be a shuttle bus but I'm not sure about that anymore). If you're looking for breakfast or lunch, the Silverfork Lodge (about a mile down the road from Solitude) is a very nice off mountain option...much more local flavor, not so ""y"" feeling.  couple of restaurants that are right in the village are quite good but I've never been too sure about the food at the Moonbeam base lodge.  mid mountain Sunshine Grill is an awesome place to catch some rays and grab a burger on the deck. Although the owners have tried to make Solitude into just another  with the ubiquitous base village and destination tourists they have failed to rob the place of it's oldtime feel and local vibe which is the main reason that Solitude is ""it""!",Tim Zheng
7587,2010-03-24,California,Heavenly Mountain,3,"This was my first time at Heavenly and I must say, I was a little disappointed.  Arrived in Tahoe about 2 days after a storm reportedly dropped 2 2.5ft of snow.  Lies I tell you!  While you could tell that they did have plenty of snow to go around, they maybe got 6 8 inches.  I will say that the snow quality was excellent for the whole weekend.  Very soft and dry.  So that's there's the background info, on with the review!

 first thing I noticed was that the runs are pretty short compared to most places I've skied (Colorado).  and most of what was on the Nevada side was blue.  We found a few blacks here and there but honestly, they were blues that had one or two trees in the middle of the run.  We spent most of the weekend over on the California side, where the runs were a bit longer.  I would like to be able to say the tree skiing that Heavenly is so well known for was amazing, but they really didn't have enough snow to do it.  Also, I didn't think the terrain was quite steep enough to call it great.  We really enjoyed the Pinnacles, when it finally opened, and the bumps on Waterfall were top notch!  We also spent a good amount of time on the Comet Lift skiing Little Dipper, also good bumps!  I can't comment on Mott and Killbrew Canyons because my Dad wasn't up to the task to ski there but I think if I were to go back I would definitely drop in there since it looked nice and steep!

By far the biggest grudge I will hold with Heavenly is their awful awful catwalks!  I have never skated so much in my life.  It takes so much effort to get around that mountain.  Do some landscaping will you!  Snowboarders were riddled all over the place on the cats where they had to de board and walk.  It took a lot of skill to avoid running into them.  

As far as a cohesive village area or town, I was very disappointed.  re is not a lot going on in S. Lake Tahoe, especially near the  base.  re were like 2 decent restaurants near the gondola and not much else.   bus to S. Lake took too long and there really isn't much over there.  Another thing is that pretty much everyone we ran into on the slopes told us to go to Kirkwood.  y all said it was way better than Heavenly.  Next time I go to Tahoe, I think I'll be skipping Heavenly.  

Did I mention overpriced like whoa?",Tim Zheng
7588,2010-03-24,Utah,Park City Mountain,4,"This must be the friendliest ski  on the planet, everyone are smiling and courteous.  You can store your skis in a locker on the snow near your morning chairlift, that's service for you.   food at the restuarants in Park City itself is great but not expensive and there is plenty to do when you aren't skiing.  Shopping at the Tanger Outlet stores is the best day off from skiing and the buses to take you there are free and constant.  We stayed at the Chateau Apres which is only a short walk to the .  It is a modest but very comfortable hotel and very affordable   I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",Tim Zheng
7589,2010-03-24,Utah,Powder Mountain,4,"Wow, does this place have the goods or what. If you can't stand the crowds in the cottonwood canyons, then this is your best bet for snowfall, terrain challenge, and untracked powder.  hill is mostly skied by locals from Ogden, and definatley does not get traffic like park city or Alta/Snowbird. That doesn't mean that it is lacking at all.  mountain's layout can be somewhat befuddling, but if you are willing to study the map, and if you are capable of skiing most terrain, you are going to have a blast here. Other benefits of this place include the fact that there are so many other forms of alternative transportation, including a bus, heli rides, and cat skiing all inbounds but not lift accessed. By far the most unique combination of alternative transportation that I've seen anywhere I've skied. It gives you a real big mountain backcountry experience without the huge additional cost or the worry about getting stuck or lost somewhere. Beware though, this is probably not the best place for families with a lot of young kids. Terrain here is challenging, and while it provides the basics, your options are going to be far more limited here than they would be in park city in terms of alternative off hill activities and other daycare ammenities. However, the price is going to be much nicer than at those s. 

Either way though, if you are looking for powder and a challenge without fancy frills and throngs of vacationers, this is the place.",Tim Zheng

7613,2010-03-26,Colorado,Vail,4,"Vail is the superstar of all ski s. It is soo big that you can ski the place for a week and find new stuff all the time. You can find deserted areas or places with people.  first day we were there the visibility was terrible and it was snowy so we stuck to the front side which was nice with tree lined runs. We got lucky and got a sunny, midweek powder day the next day, and I have never skied anywhere better than the how back bowls were that day. It was awesome as you could find fresh tracks everywhere. China Bowl is fantastic but its the most popular so there were quite a few people. Orient and Tea Cup lifts got lines towards the end of the day (but the fact so many of the lifts were high speed kept the lines moving). Blue Sky Basin was great, and with all the glades and no people it was like you were in the back country. re was untouched powder even later in the week too. Skree Field was great with DEEP powder and Iron Mask was a fantastic cornice jump with lots of pow. On the front side Riva Ridge was an awesome top to bottom run. Game Creek bowl and the Mountain Top Express area were great for cruising and moguls. Riva Glade had  lots of powder and was fun.  terrain parks had everything including 2 halfpipes and lots of jumps, boxes, etc. Vail has some problems though, like the base lift lines which can be horrendous on weekends (go here during the week and Beaver Creek on the weekend) and the outrageous prices on lift tickets and food. But overall Vail is one of, if not the, best mountain in the North America. ",Jack Frost

First I loved that it was all on one mountain, but then I realized that there was nearly always a long traverse between the lifts. n when I wanted to go out for dinner, but there were hardly any restaurants that a burger didn't cost $15 in an overcrowded Ritz Carlton. I would recommend it to families who are new to the slopes, but remember that there are still awesome double black diamonds.  ",Jack Frost
7615,2010-03-26,North Carolina,Sugar Mountain,4,"I completely second the review by 1974Vol. This is the best ski area available in the south in terms of the downhill terrains, longer runs and the lone double black. (I haven't graduated to it yet). I was there in March when the conditions were icy / slushy not exactly the best ground conditions for ski. However the availability of different terrains made for interesting ski that we ended up staying one extra day.

 lifts are quite slow though, I could be frustrating if there are long lines. Plus the staff scan your ticket *everytime* you go back in line. That could delay it a little bit more in crowded times.

Overall it is definitely worth it if you need a little more terrain to satisfy your skiing thirst.",Jack Frost

Last time I went there was brewfest Memorial Day weekend, and while the snow was sugary, it was skiable and still fun.  I would only wish there were a place to stay at the Mountain (I know, not really important, but it's nice when on vacation) but otherwise this place with its free parking and friendly community attitude is a treasure.  We stayed at the Keystone lodge a few miles up the road last May and it was night and day in approach and attitude   with A Basin being much more fin.

7622,2010-03-26,Colorado,Loveland,4,"We went to Loveland in early November to get some snow under our skis and boards as soon as we could.  We had some obvious anxiety about conditions so early in the season and were checking conditions almost daily in the weeks heading up to our trip, but Loveland more than delivered.  We arrived on a Thursday and at that point only Lift 1 was spinning, but the runs were in great shape, including both green and blue top to bottom runs.  Friday they opened up a single run off of Lift 6 (Roulette) and then on Saturday they opened Lift 2.  Snow overnight on both Thursday and Friday made conditions great for the following mornings.  Though the parking lot got crowded on Saturday there was never more than a 5 minute line for any lift.  Ski patrol was always visible and was friendly and interactive with guests.  Also saw them being very quick to respond and assist several skiers/boarders who encountered difficulties.  On this trip my wife decided to give up skiing and switch to Snowboarding.  She signed up for lessons and was very impressed with her teacher.  I will be back to Loveland next year for my early season fix (and maybe later in the season too, if I can swing it).
Only complaint is that there is no lodging immediately adjacent to the area.  We stayed in Breck (which opened during our stay, but with only one trail) and early morning commute from Breck to Loveland was scary in the non all wheel drive rental car after overnight snow.

7669,2010-03-31,California,Mammoth Mountain,5,"Mammoth is truly mammoth in terms of size.  I skied there two days and only covered a quarter of the terrain.  Not much space for beginners (relative to the overall size of the mountain) and it is broken up into three different areas...meaning a beginner ticket has to take a shuttle to ski all three areas.  My fiancee had took a lesson both days, so I was able to ski more advanced slopes, thankfully.  Saturdays are ridiculously crowded at the lodges, but it never feels too crowded on the slopes.   weather is tricky and changes by the hour at the top, so you need to plan ahead.  If you catch it after a big snowfall, it can be epic.  Accomodations are ample but they really cater to the condo crowd, so look to go with friends.  Only downside is the long drive from LA and the price of lift tickets, but I will go back a couple times next season for sure regardless.",Jeff Gibson
7672,2010-03-31,Colorado,Vail,5,"What can you say about Vail.  It simply has the largest variety of terrain.  It doesn't matter what skill level you are, you can find tons of terrain to ski at Vail.  Vail is so huge that the last three days I've skied there, I haven't skied the front side at all.  Barely even the back bowls.  I've been spending most of my time in Blue Sky Basin.  Because it's awesome.  

When a storm rolls in and dumps, it's really hard to beat Vail.  I've tried to convince myself that I like Breck better, but when you have 1.5 2ft of fresh snow all over Vail's back bowls and Blue Sky, you simply shant go elsewhere.  You can get first tracks all day because there is so much space.  As long as you stay away from the front side, the weekend crowds won't even deter you getting tons of runs in.  I was there for the 1.5 2ft dump the last weekend in March and it was the best skiing I've ever done at Vail.  Blue Sky Basin is where it's at.  Fantastic tree skiing, some cliffs to fly off, and steep challenging terrain.  If you haven't seen Vail yet, book your trip next Winter and be amazed.  But plan to ski there at least 3 4 days so you can try everything once.

But, if it's during the week on a pow day, it's possible to get a good look at the mountain that spawned Glen Plake.",bigw1313
7710,2010-04-03,California,Northstar California,2,"When you arrive at NorthStar you find a bunch of other people ready to slow you down.  Parking was congested but then again its all where you park and when you arrive.  After parking you take a bus to the main  area.   idea of this is to keep you away from your car so the  can get you to spend money.  I recommend packing a lunch and hanging out on the mountain because going back to the car here seems to be a long trip.   Although the food(pizza)was awesome.   mountain gets a lot of sun bring sunscreen.  I boarded on a powder day and had a blast but during that day and the next day the sun had eaten the mountain making everything icy.  Lots of intermediate runs with no advanced riding in sight.  Northstar is a big mountain so it would take time to discover all it has to offer.  Every day is different like everyones opinions I think this mountain lacks some lodging service and its overcrowded, sun exposed, bad service lodging, makes this one of the worst s to dream about.",ONTHESHITER
7713,2010-04-07,California,Sierra at Tahoe,2,Sierra is the first  off of weekend crowded Highway 50 to south Lake Tahoe people tend to stop there.  Every run here seems short and getting around the mountain was confusing.  I kept wanting to go some place new and kept coming back to the same area.  I'm sure this mountain has something great to offer but I never found it.  I talked to  a local at Kirkwood and they said Sierra is good on a windy day because Kirkwood isn't.  Sierra seems like a place where people go that are not to serious about their riding or conditions.,ONTHESHITER

This place is much cheaper than surrounding areas such as Mt. Sunapee and Pat's Peak. re is much for the beginner to do at this small, not intimidating mountain.  high intermediate will do well on their black diamonds under right conditions the advanced will have nothing to do. Some of the lifts just drop you off a near vertical drop to get to the trails. Another thing to know if going on a powder day: re will be ice and there will be moguls and they will be very close together. Anybody knows that if you lose rhythm and go over the mogul catching some air, you will fall on ice and there will be a lot of force on your ankles if you aren't ready.

7744,2010-04-24,Idaho,Bogus Basin,1,"Bogus is truly a local gem. That being said however, don't confuse local with uncrowded. Even so, the mountain is a great community asset and a challenge for anyone looking for some good lines. Here are some observations.

Affordability: Day ticket is going to set you back close to $50, BUT, this is buying you 13 hours of skiing on the weekend, or 12 hours during the week, because the mountain has night skiing (and quite a lot of it too). If you are a local lucky enough to get a season pass, this mountain is easily one of the most affordable in the country. Also, their passport program gets beginners a season pass, a season long lease package, and four lessons for $280. Where else will you find that? Another interesting note, Bogus is a non profit, and is wholly dedicated to serving the community. 

Terrain:  best part about Bogus in my mind is that it is literally an entire mountain plus more, so it actually has an incredible selection of runs that face in every cardinal direction. You can follow the sun around the mountain or you can stick to chair 3 on the backside and never see daylight and ski the soft stuff all day. Tree skiing is relatively short but still available. re is nothing insanely steep on the mountain. Probably nothing over 35 degrees, but there is an abundance of that kind of terrain if you stay on the backside or ski the face. Of course there are nice blue cruisers (mostly on the back) and a more limited ammount of beginner terrain. Kind of limited on the vert (1800'), but there is no lack of acreage. 

Crowds: Best to avoid the weekends if you can. This mountain is pretty much the only thing around for well over 100 miles for the 450,000 people in the Boise metro. Unlike Salt Lake or Denver, there are not a plethora of other great s to disperse the crowds, but it's definately no , so you don't have to wade through a mess of base lodges, ski chalets, or take a gondola from the parking lot. Midweek after the holidays, you'l have 2600 acres to yourself.

Terrain Park: Unfortunately, this mountain doesn't support runs dedicated to a well laid out terrain park, meaning you will find a disjointed selection of rails and jumps off different runs that don't access each other. y usually put two kickers and a quarter pipe up for their main park, and beside that on another separate run they put the rails, boxes, etc. re is also a very small terrain park off of another lift. If you are a dedicated jibber, you are not going to find the flow here like you would at a destination . 

Snow: Probably the biggest downside to Bogus. Certainly not a unique problem, but storms are inconsistent and unreliable because 1.)   is not at a high enough elevation (5900 base, 7700 summit) to remain consistently cold during wet, warm pacific fronts 2.) it is not at a high enough lattitude to support consistently cold weather year round, and 3.) the Boise Mountains are not high enough to force the uplift that traps storms like the Wasatch front, the Tetons, or elsewhere. What does this mean? Only 220 inches annually, if they are lucky. Rain has been a consistent problem in early December and in the spring, and mid season high pressure thaws can be particularaly punishing to the overall snowpack and especially all of the mountains south facing slopes. This low snowfall is only made worse by some lackluster grooming. I hate to be hard on my own mountain, but far too often is too little attention paid to grooming runs to ensure maximum snow retention: ie, not grooming down to or over dirt, actually moving snow around to cover dirt and exposed areas, targeting the limited snowmaking infrastructure to the tops of rollers that are constantly scarce for snow, etc. This is much less of a problem in the late season, but in scarce snow years and the holiday season, make sure you watch out for rocks and twigs on what are normally great groomers.  plus side? This mountain is SUNNY. Familiar with Sun Valley?  weather is actually pretty similar to Bogus. Stormy days are a lot like anywhere else, but this mountain definately has an abundance of sun, so if you are a fair weather skiier staying for a week, you will probably spend at least 5 of your days in some brilliant sunshine. Also, when the valley is in an inversion and socked in with fog and pollution, Bogus sits high above it all with the bluest skies you could imagine.

Ammenities: No frills here folks. Two lodges that serve up lunch cafeteria/fast food style.  food is definately good though, but kind of pricy. Feel free to bring your lunch (and dinner for night skiing!) if you don't want to shell out.

Finally, the Road: Bogus Basin Road builds character. 16 miles and 172 curves, one way. You'll also climb about 3200 feet out of the valley to the base of the mountain. y are good about plowing and sanding it, and it is heavily travelled on the weekends, but if it is dumping mid week, make sure you have 4wd and probably snow tires, and expect an hour trip up in bad weather.",Colin
7746,2010-04-26,New Hampshire,Bretton Woods,4,"Although it was Good Friday,there were virtually no lift lines,and the variety of well covered trails was impressive.
 views of snow capped Mt. Washington  and the other presidentials were great .We almost had the west side of the area to ourselves at times.My only gripes would be: 1.  the location of the trail signs,which often only pointed in the vague direction of where the trails actually began ( All five of us  rarely knew the name and level  of the trail we were skiing on,an important consideration for skill  challenged low intermediates like me who want reasonable assurance of making it down without  having to battle all the way.)2.  cafeteria prices  were ,as at most s,bordering on obscene.However,we've  learned to bring our own food.Underestimating how warm it would be,however,we were all ripped off on the soft drinks we  had to buy to slake our raging thirst.I think some would draw crowds by having reasonably priced victuals.Despite these two complaints,however,we had a wonderful day of skiing  better,in fact,than we  expected.",Danny Zhang
7747,2010-04-26,California,Mt. Baldy,1,"I visited Mt Baldy twice this year, the last time on April 24 2010.  I like this  for its proximity to LA, but I really think that the management of this  should train their staff to be customer friendly.   staff at the ticket office is just rude.  y make you wait while they chat with one another behind the window, and ignore you.  You need  to remind them several times that you are waiting.  If you want to unload elderly passengers, they start screaming.  at Chair 1, the first staff you see to take the lift up the mountain, literally yells at you if he can't see your lift ticket.  I injured my hand when I fell, and I asked several ski patrols if they had a bandaid, to no avail.  But I was suprised to find the staff at the ski rental shop there to be friendly.  y bend over ackwards to help you, give the best skis they have and put you in the most comfortable boots.

7789,2010-08-28,Vermont,Smugglers' Notch,2,"Skied Smuggs on Xmas day.   mountain was empty and I got discount lift tickets from liftopia for $22, which was awesome.  I was the first (after ski patrol) up Madonna1 and it was beautiful.  Despite being early season, there was a ton of snow.   I enjoyed the variety of terrain, but I did wish there were more trails/glades cut into the huge amount of space. 

 lifts are all fixed grip doubles, which are slow.  This definitely eats into the carving time, especially for Madonna1 which is a long, long ride.

 beginner area is awesome for teaching and it has lots of beginner terrain.  Employees were very friendly.

If you like bumps and glades McCauley has the best; they have bump and glade runs for beginners right up to a true expert, with big drop type runs. McCauley also has great cruiser runs from gentle slopes to steep headwalls. On the lower mountain there are great runs for the beginners who are just getting started, once you have mastered the lower mountain you are ready for the top. In 2010 McCauley added new terrain features for there terrain park, and have made big improvements in the past couple of years. This mountain has terrain for every level of skier in the family, not to mention the best prices around. I have found this to be the best value around for ski mountains. Right now McCauley has some of the best conditions in NY, they have been getting snow almost every day and have been pumping out the snow for a great base. y have also purchased a new groomer and grinder for 2010 creating some of the best groomed trails around.

Having skiied big mountains like Telluride & Taos I was blown away by the quality and quantity of snow at Snowbird.  scenery is verticle and legendary and the value is unreal compared to places in Colorado. I highly recommend Snowbird and would say that it was the greatest ski experience I've ever had.

7800,2010-09-17,Vermont,Sugarbush,5,"We spent a week at Sugarbush March 12 19 with the whole family.  I ski, while my wife prefers her snowboard, and the kids went to ski school, so we got a fairly good sampling of what the  has to offer.  Spent 4 of our days skiing at Mt. Lincoln and 2 days at Mt. Ellen.  Lines were never a problem and the lifts were quick and well operated.

I loved skiing the Mt. Lincoln area.  re was so much variety.  Nice wide cruisers like Pushover or Hotshot off of the Gatehouse to beautiful tree covered trails like Sleeper, Lower Jester, and Moonshine gave you two different experiences.  n up to the top lifts for Organgrinder, Middle Earth, and the Birch Run was yet another type of fun.  When we were there most of the black runs were left to bump, and some of the blues as well (Moonshine, Birch).  Organgrinder had bumps for the top portion and then transitioned into a nice fast cruiser at the bottom.  A nice workout.  re were many more trails I would recommend, but my overall recommendation is just to explore as much as you can.  Never found a trail I didn't enjoy.

I did wish they would have groomed some of the more advanced runs, but talking to staff they indicated that while the late season conditions were the reason for the lack of grooming.  When we started the week conditions were great, but towards the end of the week it would be a little icy in the morning and quite slushy by the afternoon.

I was less impressed with the Mt. Ellen area, mainly due to conditions there being icier and most of the black trails having bumps the size of an old VW bug.  I did thoroughly enjoy Lower F.I.S.  Absolute solitude in a stunning mountain environment.  Even saw moose tracks across the trail at one point and didn't see another skier for the entire 30+ minute run.  It does flat out at the bottom, but the scenery is so beautiful that the extra work was well worth it.  Semi tough was also nice, but the rest of the trails were a let down after the days at Lincoln.

Ski school for the kids (6 and 4 years old) was hit or miss based on the instructor.   kids had one instructor for two of the days (1 and 3 day) that they really enjoyed and we could see great progress.  We also skied with them after ski school.  Second day the instructor couldn't really be bothered to push them when they wanted to stop, so I didn't feel it went all that well.   last day was the ultimate disaster.  Around pick up time my wife was headed for the ski school building to pickup and encountered my six year old daughter being helped by a non staff good samaritan and hysterically crying.  My daughter had fallen down and the teacher must have lost count/track of class and left my daughter behind about halfway down the mountain.  She had trouble gathering her skis and soon fell out of sight of the class and was crying for help when the passerby found her.  y got her down to the school, where I will give credit that the teacher immediately apologized and took responsibility for the problem, but the damage was done.  It took a lot of effort to get my daughter back out on the slopes and on my list of inexcusable mistakes leaving my child on the slope unattended is at the top.  My rating would have been five stars for Sugarbush if not for this one very bad experience.

I still would recommend Sugarbush and plan on returning.",papi6022
7805,2010-09-26,California,Mountain High,3," mountain closed one run early today because of a disgrunted paton over all the puddles at the turnstiles.   guy in charge saw the unhappy customer and had the patol say the mountain was closed.

When you walk in the lodge there seems to be a feeling of friendliness in the air.  staff seems genuinely happy that you are there.  food service is much better this year too. No more getting your burger and fries from under the heat lamps, all orders are cooked fresh, it tastes good, and is not terribly expensive.  new Mystic Miner website is a vast improvement, I love the photo gallery and virtual rides.  one thing missing is a trail map, there is not one on the website and even though I asked there were not any available in the lodge. For now the facilities are pretty much the same. re have been no changes to the slopes and lifts. y have been blessed with a lot of snow this year and the runs are good. This is a great place to bring your family. My non skiing wife likes the fact that the bunny slope is right in front of the lodge and she can watch the kids while she sits and reads. I like the fact that new skiers do not need to be good at stopping, there is a nice flat area where all the front side runs end and you will stop with little effort from the skier. On the front side there is a Poma lift and a triple chair. I have never been a big fan of Poma's but they are simple. Nightlife: world famous Deadwood with is casinos is about 8 miles away, while the more metropolitan Rapid City is about 50 miles away. Both towns have plenty of restaurants, rooms, entertainment, and shopping. Lodging: unlike most ski areas the Black Hills are primarily a summer destination so in the winter lodging is abundant and inexpensive, rooms can be had for less than $50 per night.

7823,2010-10-17,California,Mt. Baldy,4,"I moved to Southern California last year, and heard about the great deal Mt Baldy had on   an season pass for under $100, which they are doing again for the 10 11 season.  It's a bargain, and last year we more than got our money's worth.  This place is by no means a ski , nor is it a huge mountain that people could come and enjoy themselves for a week on, but we went 12 times last year on day trips, and each time we had a blast.   slopes were never crowded, although there are few lifts and they go slowly.  Sure, the place could do with development, but I guess if that happens more people will turn up and the prices will increase, so i'd rather keep it as it is.  I wouldnt recommend the place for beginners, there is a newbie area but its very limited.  I would say its best for skiers and snowboarders who are comfortable with blue runs.  Otherwise, you're not going to have the most fun here.  ",Erik Szayna
7827,2010-10-19,Colorado,Breckenridge,4,"I visited Breckenridge about 2 years ago and when i went it snowed practically every day so the conditions were perfect.  It took us about 4 hours to get there from Denver because of a blizzard which closed off route 70 and left us with only 2 hours of skiing that day.   mountain offered slopes from beginners all the way to advanced but it is more for the intermediate skiers due to the lack of green runs closer to the peak of the mountain.  re are 4 peaks peak 7, peak 8, peak 9, and peak 10.  My favorite was peak 10 it had incredibly long blue runs along with some black diamonds.   first day i was trapped going down a black diamond on my first run because the snow and the wind caused me to misread a sign.  Peak 9 had some really good runs and so did peak 8.  I didnt spend much time on peak 7 because there was not a lot of runs and they were mostly short blue and green runs.  I couldn't try out some of the tougher double black diamonds near the top because it was closed due to the snow.   jumps at the terrain parks were huge and i only attempted it once because i was not much of a freestyle skier at the time.  From what i have heard the terrain parks at Breckenridge are some of the best in Colorado.   lift lines were not too bad and they were fast lifts.   view at the top cannot be explained in words.   only bad thing i experienced here was the amount of foreign people here and the inability for them to direct you to your lodging.

With the hotel/casino an easy walk to the gondola life was good.  Winning at the tables didn't hurt either.  I would recomend lunch at the Lake View Lodge because for the same price of the other quick lunch places you got a truly wonderful meal with a great view and excellent service.",Nick Pope
7842,2010-10-24,Colorado,Silverton Mountain,5,"My buddies and I had been thinking of going to Silverton for a few years now, it was always too long of a trip, or not the right time for the whole group – what a mistake. This place is so otherworldly I feel like I might of missed out by not coming earlier. We skied 5 of the best runs of the year, not always because of super deep pow (which we did find) but because of the huge variety – tight chutes, steep open faces, sheltered trees and some sweet natural features. It really is amazing that so much can be accessed by just one lift when you put in a little grunt work on the hikes. I was a little intimidated by all the talk of death and danger, but once the day got going our guide (Stan) loosened up and we had a great time. He did make sure to keep an eye on us as we skied one at a time, which I appreciated considering the avalanches that run around there.
I understand why some of the reviewers could be upset because I saw some ‘bros’ in the yurt when I got there that seemed too cool for school. se same folks also looked super tired (as did I) at the end of the day in the bar at the yurt. 
We are already planning our trip for next season so we don’t have to miss out on another great time – I can’t wait!",Nick Pope
7843,2010-10-24,Colorado,Telluride,5," new terrain Telluride is simply awsome! If you are a flat lander the altitude is tough but so is T ride!   first day we were there we hit the new Revolation Bowl off the bat ( gets skiied out fast because it isn't that big). n they opened up Gold Hill chutes 6 9, and the new Stairway to the Heavens!  Ski Patrol opened the stairway and we were the first up. It was not a mad dash because coming from 600' and hiking at 13,000' the first day was agonizing and I'm in shape!  If you do this hike (highly recommend) let your body get used to the elev. not on the first day. Every year this place gets better.",Nick Pope
7844,2010-10-24,Colorado,Purgatory Mountain,4,"I reviewed DMR (aka Purgatory) a couple years ago, but after skiing it again last weekend, felt my review warranted an update.

I still like Purgatory a lot, and love the town of Durango.  However, the terrain options here do pale a bit in comparison to some big s I've skied lately.  If you enjoy cruising nice groomers, there are a lot of wide boulevards that you'll find agreeable.  If you're looking for steeper, more demanding trails, or bump skiing, there's some of that, too, but not a great deal of it.  re is a new area for tree skiing that's been added this year called McCormick's Maze, to the far right side of the mountain off Lift 8.  I didn't get a chance to ski it, but it's nice to see the mountain expanding the options for advanced skiers.  Purgatory doesn't really cater to that crowd, however...I suspect they realize that the young chargers in this area of Colorado are either skiing Silverton, 40 miles up the road, or skinning up tracks in the San Juan backcountry, not shelling out bucks for a lift ticket.

Speaking of the lift network, it could use some investment.  Lift 5 is a creaky old double chair, and even the triple on Lift 8 is pretty darn slow and doesn't even have a foot rest.  Call me fussy, but if I'm skiing laps, I'd like to rest my tired old legs on the ride up.

As I said in my original review, the 4 star nightlife rating is for the town of Durango, 25 miles away from the .  if you are staying on the mountain, you'll have to make your own fun.  I recommend staying in Durango, or close by, because it's a great 4 season mountain town with some really great restaurants.  Try the Southwest Chicken Pizza at the Steamworks Brewing Co., chased down with a Conductor IPA.

7856,2010-10-30,California,Palisades Tahoe,4,"Squaw Valley is a great mountain.  It was an Olympic Village in the 60's.  Just like the rest of Lake Tahoe they stand to get pounded with tons of maritime snowpack( Sierra Cement).  One thing to consider is violent storms pound this mountain and can sometimes produce winds in upwards of 60 70 mph at the peaks.  This can make for a variety of problems like closed lifts, zero visbility conditions, as well as avalanche loading.  I don't know how well the ski patrol checks avalanche danger but my experience is when you have big snow and high winds it can make for very unpredictable snow pack and possibility of slides.   facilities are world class and the terrain has a great variety.  Some gentle slopes for the weekend warrior or some super steep for the Crunchies.  This mountain is very unique due to the lack of tree's and therefor identified runs.  I'd guess the lack of trees is due to the winds.  But on a blue bird day these open runs can give a freerider alot of options for great lines in any direction.",Nick Pope

7863,2010-11-02,California,Bear Mountain,4,"Yes I claim that Bear Mountain is the best  in Southern California but before you plan your next trip there, being the best ski  in SoCal is not saying very much. When I snowboard locally it was usually at Mountain High but I decided to take a day trip up to Bear in March not expecting it to be much better than MH. However, I was pleasantly surprised how much fun I had at Bear. ir Terrain  Park was a lot of fun, and from what I could tell it had jumps and jibs for all levels.  extra hour or two drive to Big Bear is definitely worth how much better it is than Baldy or Mountain High.

That being said, Bear Mountain is still pretty crowded and the snow quality is not very good. If you are going for steep runs and powder sorry you are wasting your time at Bear.  double blacks are like blues at Mammoth so I would not recommend Bear to skiers because it is mainly terrain park oriented. Also, I would only recommend Bear for a day trips with a couple friends and not for a full on skiing vacation. My reasoning is that if you are willing to spend the money for accommodations and other expenses then Mammoth, Tahoe, or Utah are so much more worth it. Also Mammoth, Tahoe, and Park City all have things to do other than ski. I actually talked with a local at Bear and he said it was boring living in Big Bear because there is nothing to do but snowboard.

Overall, Bear Mountain is by far the best  in Southern California but I would only recommend it for snowboarders between the ages of 12 and 25 who love to push their limits on terrain parks or for riders who want a warm up before going to an actual .",johnny alonso

A real powder day.  type of day where you are eating snow, all day. This is a powder skiers mountain. I don't really know why more people don't go vacation at Wolf Creek. If I were a family of four that loved skiing and didn't need the bar scene, I'd vacation at Wolf Creek. It's like a poor man's Steamboat, except with more snow.

It was going great until they decided to shut down the lifts at like 12:00.  y said the top of the mountain was too windy and too dangerous.  We thought ok the top is a little advanced we wont miss out on much.  n as the day went by and the sun started to disapear they started closing down every lift in the middle of the mountain!!  I mean come on!  n it started raining and we tried to go back and forth to different parts only to get turned down saying the lifts were closed.  n we ended up skiing one part of the mountain which was purely a green.

7891,2010-11-10,Virginia,Wintergreen,3,"I am quite conflicted about Wintergreen.  On one hand, it is a very nice  with all the amenities and fairly good slopes:  However, the lift lines on the weekend are truly horrible.  We went on President's Day weekend, which was apparently a mistake, as everyone else seemed to be there also.

What was surprising is that the slopes weren't crowded at all, especially Tyro and the lower blacks, but what was even more surprising is that the lift lines were amazingly long.  During the afternoon on Sunday, I routinely waited 20 minutes for every lift.  Also, I was a guest of a member and had the ""special red badge"", but halfway through the day, some of the staff decided that we couldn't use our badges and thus couldn't use the special lift lines.  My wife had only 3 hours to ski (infant with babysitter) and only got in 4 runs in 3 hours.

My two kids did the Treehouse all day ski school and really didn't enjoy it at all.  My 8yo is extremely athletic and was bored after one hour.  My 5yo is not extremely athletic and apparently was harassed by some other kids to the point that she was in tears much of the day.  I took them to another  last weekend for private lessons and they did very well.  Lesson learned on group ski lessons for kids.

Overall, Wintergreen is a really nice .  I have been there more than 10 times in the past few years, but only skiing twice.  Both times I skied, the lift lines have been out of proportion to the number of skiers.  y just don't seem to have the lift capacity to get people back up the mountain.

7913,2010-11-17,Indiana,Perfect North Slopes,4,If your comparing PNS to places out west you might as well stay home. However if you are saying PNS isn't challenging you obviously aren't trying to hard to find a challenge. Runs like hollywood or showtime when bumped up would be ranked as some of the hardest for sure in the southern Midwest and ranks high in the north even. When it comes to grooming PNS is pretty much amazing almost to the point of annoying for grooming out all the bumps! y have seven groomers which is more than some places that are 10 times the size of PNS have out west. Yes it does get icy in the evenings but when it gets up above freezing and then drops at night thats what happens. Most weekends they groom again at about 8PM for the late night. Weekends do get packed but it starts to empty out around 8 PM and then you can ski till 1 AM with fairly empty slopes. PNS  has cheap lift tickets if you don't think so do some comparison shopping they are usually around 50% cheaper than a lot of places. Overall if you are looking to have a good time with out the expense of going out west hit up PNS.,wolfman

I asked four outside employees how to get there, two told me they didn't know one told me that it was closed, and the other indicated that it hadn't been open much this season. I skied down to the lodge, took off my skis, and went inside to ask the woman at the information desk how to find it. She told me it was closed. When i pointed out that the trail report laying on the desk in front of her listed it as open, she replied, ""n it is open.""

On the down side the runs are not very challenging for an advanced skier/boarder due to the small size of the .

7963,2010-12-01,Pennsylvania,Big Bear,4,"Ski Big Bear at Masthope Mountain is one of the lesser known Pocono s. Located far from the I 80 corridor that is home to several of the more well known s, getting to Big Bear takes some effort, but is usually worth the drive. With 650 feet of vertical drop, it is tied for #8 in Pennsylvania, offering more hill than some of the more well known s in eastern PA. Additionally, its family friendly atmosphere and layout make it easy and enjoyable for parents to ski and ride with their kids, or simply watch them progress in the beginner area. 

 majority of the staff members are friendly locals who return season after season.  lift attendants will greet you when you board the chairlift, the instructors make learning fun and interesting, and the people who work behind the scenes handle most issues before they even arise. 

 downside to Big Bear is that the terrain is not very challenging for an advanced skier or rider. re are four black diamond slopes, the two steepest of which are not lit for night skiing, so experts who venture here after dark will probably be let down by the lack of available terrain. Additionally, bumps are scarce. 

On the plus side, Big Bear has two magic carpets lifts to serve the beginner area, which can be crowded on busy weekends. It is an upside down  with the lodge and easier terrain at the top, so another double chairlift starts just below the beginner area and also serves the same terrain making it very easy for learners to get back to the top and get more runs. A second double chairlift serves the mid mountain area and is favored by those using the terrain park and advanced runs. This lift can be crowded at times but one can ski a bit further to the twin double chairlifts at the very bottom and opt to ride all the way back to the top.  twin double lift was added for the 2009 10 season to alleviate the congestion at the bottom of the mountain. Older reviews mention the crowded bottom lift, and this new improvement seems to have cut down some of the wait time.

Big Bear has enough terrain to keep novice and intermediate skiers well occupied. re are over two dozen trail combinations from the top to the bottom and connectors and side trails boost that count a bit higher. Unfortunately, due to the confines of its location, expanding the amount of trails is not something that is likely going to occur. Big Bear is located in a private community and homes line the ski boundary on both sides. Instead, Big Bear will most likely focus on the terrain park and improving the amenities. Since 2005 they have built a new ski lodge, added two magic carpets, installed the twin double chairlift, and radically expanded the snowmaking capabilities. 

Ski Big Bear is open Wednesdays and Thursdays: Noon 9pm; Fidays and Saturdays: 9am 9pm; Sundays and Mondays: 9am 4:30pm and is closed on Tuesdays. Holiday hours vary as well.  best times to ski Big Bear are during the day on Mondays and Fridays. On those days you can maximize daylight skiing opportunities and still avoid the weekend rush.

7984,2010-12-07,Utah,Solitude Mountain,4,"Gosh, where to begin?  My g/f and I were looking into buying a place in either Big Cottonwood Canyon (""BCC"") or Little Cottonwood Canyon (""LCC""), and while Alta/Snowbird certainly do suit my skiing ""style"" better, Solitude couldn't have been a better combined choice for us.   base village is quaint, and everything is close.  We have ski in/out access without any hassle, from our new condo, and at a good discount to Alta/Snowbird.  I think that Solitude gets more snow than Alta/Snowbird, or maybe it's just the fact that the snow stays around longer, due to the lack of crowds.   terrain has both a tame (beginner/intermediate) side, as well as a wilder (advanced/expert) side.  Certainly there are not as many cliffs as there are at Alta/Snowbird, but whenever I feel the need to huck myself over a cliff, I am not too far from LCC!!!  Solitude even has access to backcountry terrain!!!  I am really impressed by the place, since I thought we were buying the ""minivan"" of ski mountains, in Utah, which it certainly is not.  I'll take Solitude over any ski mountain, any day of the week, and twice on Sundays!  

Of course, on the downside, the apres ski scene is not quite ""up to par"" but the place is still attracting more interest, and that takes time to develop.  So, if it's apres ski I am after, I take the drive down BCC, into Sandy, or Draper, or even the dreaded Park City, which I avoid like the black plague, as the pretensions of the place really do overwhelm me, to no end, just like Aspen/Snowmass, in my native Colorado!!!  But nevetheless, all those places in Utah are near Solitude, so they are within reasonable driving distances.  Personally, I don't think much of the apres ski scene in either canyon, and for the pure skier, that is acceptable, to be so close to my beloved slopes.  

To conclude, Solitude is definitely a great ski mountain with fantastic terrain and AWESOME snow!!!  It's close to everything, yet reccessed from it all, at the same time.  What it lacks in an apres ski environment, it more than makes up for, in all the areas it does well, which happen to be the only areas in which I care: SKIING!!!  ",cheezywhiz
7985,2010-12-07,Pennsylvania,Montage Mountain,3,"I went to Montage Mountain twice this year... Once on Christmas Eve 2009 and once for a night skiing session in February 2010.

I had fun both times but Sno is definitely a goofy mountain. 

First, it's right off 84 in Scranton. So you drive into the city to go skiing and the scenery suffers (you can see Home Depot from the lower section.) It's also a summer time park, so there's a water slide by the lodge and skeeball on the inside. Not your ordinary mountain. 

That said, the trails can be pretty fun    especially on the lower section. If you go earlier in the day while there's still snow and no ice on those runs you can get some spectacular speed. and there's no lift line at the bottom.  top section is okay    good for beginners who want their first taste of intermediate trails. and the top is also way wider than the bottom. 

**you can also park near the lifts for the lower section and get your lift ticket there without going to the main lodge. 

Overall, Sno is good for a quick fix. I can tell it brings in local crowds from the city who are looking to hang out in the lodge but on the mountain the lift lines weren't too bad    compared to more crowded places in the Poconos. 

You can get in some good runs and since it's close to the freeway, it's easy to get to. Also compared to other s, lift tickets were more affordable. and the bar has cheap drinks.

Which is good because you'll need a drink to put up with the incredibly slow lifts... bring a friend so you can talk and pass the time. ",ryan
7990,2010-12-09,Pennsylvania,Whitetail,5,"Ive been reminding myself to post a review on my experience at Whitetail last season (2009 2010) Ive surfed and skated all my life   and prior to this one day at whitetail   ive never snowboarded. but i was determined to learn how to board and i was excited to try. So i decided to take a lesson with one of the snow coaches at the . i signed up for one of the group classes early in the morning   i ended up being the only guy on the roster :) juan paolo (my instructor) took me thru the basics, the right way   not the way i have been poorly mentally conditioning myself to ride. the ""one on one"" lesson was everything a beginner could ask for. jp was super articulate, ""watch and copy what i do"" technique, very patient and able to see what youre doing wrong and try to adjust it before it becomes habitual. seriously   juan paolo had me riding with confidence sporting a snowboarder's stance within the hour. and i was having a blast with my new found sport. of course i bit the ground a bunch of times that day   but i at least knew WHY i it happened  ;p trying out a new sport can be very intimidating   especially when everyone knows what theyre doing....everyone but you that is. whitetail's beginner classes i totally recommend to anyone looking to learn or to sharpen their skills. final grade A+
the facilities are great. very nice atmosphere   very ""sundance"" like.  common area was well maintained and clean, lots of lockers to stash your gear. a friendly snowboard/ski check in staff. i so totally recommend checking your board & skis   there was zero security overlooking the open public racks   total theft city. the restaurants/coffee shop are nice   but waaaaaay overpriced. almost laughable. i recommend filling a cooller   itll be much cheaper on your wallet. but beyond the minor notes and fair warnings   the place overall gets a B++
now on the downside  i wasn't impressed with some of the snowboarders and skiers when it came to etiquette on the mountain. why do they feel the need to just sit in the middle of the run becoming yet another obstacle to hurdle and face? i wish there were signs or ski patrol enforcing the rule to just sit on the side of the run   not the middle of it! c'mon man, youd think these dudes were having a coffee and a smoke talking about last night's game   really uncool. am i the only one that has a problem with this? maybe its me   but safety for both parties does come to mind in this particular situation. 
On the ground   parking. it would be nice if whitetail would salt/clean the lots   especially when its snowing. i saw a car get dented in the lot because some dude was trying to get out of a spot which of course turned into a hit and run. i dont know about you but i would be super pissed if that happened to my jeep. common courtesy to others and their property seems to be lacking   is that too much to ask for? Grade D
Overall   my experience at Whitetail was awesome   and if it wasnt for jp showing me how to board   i wouldnt be jonezing to go riding tonite. Final grade: B+",johnny alonso
7993,2010-12-10,Ohio,Alpine Valley Ohio,2,"I went here with friends after not skiing over the last 25 years, and then went several times while relearning to ski.  

As a place to learn, it is fine.   runs are short, not steep, and it's rarely too crowded.

However, there is a steep learning curve for newbies   once the bunny hill is mastered, you have to take a tow rope up a very steep hill (relatively speaking), and then have to make your way down the hill to one of two lifts.  It can be intimidating for brand new skiers / riders.  Besides that, it is actually a good place to learn the very basics.

 bad thing, besides the tow rope to get up and over the central hill, is that it seems like the hill is never fully open.  y have terrain features and trails that have a little variety, but unfortunately are usually closed.",loricipheran

Some of the steeps off the Sierra lift were also open providing further early season challenge. Copper has plenty of blue cruisers and gentle greens to go along with its black fare. ",ParkLife
8001,2010-12-12,Maine,Sunday River,5,"It would be great if there were better signage and patrol on the hill to help slow down the racers when they are NOT in the race course. y need to give more space when skiing around others.  Boyne rewards card is impossible to get the points added on to the account after the fact like everyone tells me.   reciepts I kept are to be added, but the on line system has many problems and does not let you log on.  
 grooming, snow making and services were much better when ASC owned it. Now there are ridges and frozen snow because they groom it too early and don't let the water drain out and let people ski it out like they used to.
Too crowded in trail intersections, need a patroller or embassador there to slow floks down. Where are the embassadors, they were a great asset and made everyones experience on the slopes so much less stressful. Bring'em Back!

High I was greatly disapointed with LVSSR. I went to LVSSR a total of 4 5 times...  rest were spent at Brainhead and Mt high( I live in Vegas and Los Angeles)
 reasons for disapointment: 3 lifts... 1 leading to bunny slopes, 2 leading to a downhill, 3 leading to a mediocre park. That's it... Of course there are a couple different paths to choose from but nothing amazing.  main dissapointment is the price... $55 for half day and $60 for full day! Really?! This is how you treat your locals? re is not even any specials. No night skiing. No discounts. Nadda!
I do see potential if they can lower the prices and have specials... ala: 2ppl 4 1 days, Half price days, $10 off days, Stamp cards(Buy 4 days get ur 5 day free) SOMETHING! ANYTHING! Night skiing would be great too!

8050,2010-12-20,New York,Peekn Peak,4,"We go here a couple times a year, and I generally enjoy it.  With night skiing on the whole mountain, you can do a lot of skiing.

It can get icy in spots, but that's to be expected as it is an eastern .  Anothing thing is how short the trails are.  However, the lift lines are usually very quick.

re is a variety on the mountain from easy to (kind of) difficult.  My skill level is starting to surpass the hill, but if I venture into the terrain areas, or if they've got the (VERY SHORT) mogul area, I can challenge myself.  BTW, I am not really into terrain parks, but they can spice up an otherwise repetitive day.

 bad thing is that this is by far the worst place for snowboarders.  se kids are always plopping down in the middle of a trail to pull out their cell phones and have conversations.  Several times a day, I'll come over a steep part, where downward visibility is severely limited, just to have to go into panic mode because these boarders will sit down right out of sight, and now I have to stop or veer to avoid them.  For whatever reason, these kids will NOT go to the edges of trails to sit.  I've met considerate people, skiers and boarders, all over the place, but PnP makes me despise snowboarders.",loricipheran

Being a Southern California guy myself, it's very convenient to get to; only two hours from my home town, a large ski .  But the fact is, by any other standards, it's just not that good.   conditions are horrible.  y rely heavily on snowmaking, and they are quite good at it, but it still is icey and not that great.  y have no ungroomed bowls and no powder.   good thing is that their excellent grooming prevents moguls.  y only have 31 runs, and only 3 expert runs.  y only have 1 run which is green the whole way through, but the blue courses would be considered green at any other .  

That being said, there is one good thing.  ir rating system is exceedingly relaxed, which means that intermediate skiers can ski blue and intermediate skiers can ski black.  However, advanced skiers will find very little for them there, because of a decreased amount of steeps.

Overall, Big Bear is a relatively average ski  with little to offer except for a convenient location.  Beginner and intermediate skiers will be able to ski higher than their level.  However, it is very family friendly and excellent for young and inexperienced skiers.  Still, the proprietors could do better to make it more difficult.",treesker

This year (March 26 28) was better than ever. Still had a significant snow base on all open trails (about 4 were closed out of 37). re is some excellent downhill here. Did every trail but the ""bumpy"" ones and they all had good snow coverage. ""Twister"" was a great blue run and ""White Lightning"" was my favorite black. WIDE and steep and long. Morning grooming was great but by lunch, things were pretty slushy, especially on the easier trails that most people took. Most of the staff was nice but none were very professional except for one nice guy working in the cafeteria. I think someone else suggested getting the staff some matching jackets (or overalls). Food was marginal and they don't allow brown bagging in the cafeteria area. y have three lifts  a double to the beginners trail and two triples to the top of the mountain. re's one triple that has a stop at about one quarter up the mountain and another that goes straight to the top. I've never seen the latter running.  one that does run is very slow and it takes almost 10 minutes to get to the top. Since it services beginner trails as well, there are usually several stops while you're heading up. But, the vertical and trails are worth the wait.

8151,2011-01-04,Wisconsin,Devils Head,5,"Several of us from Chicagoland made a road trip to Devil's head on the 4 5 of Dec, 2010.  It was still the preseason, so only part of the mountain was open.  To compensate for the lack of trails being open, lift tickets were 20% off and the rooms were only $50 each   certainly a fair deal.  
I was impressed with the extent of the facilities.  cafeteria had a great view, and food at Dante's where we had breakfast was good.  Another reviewer has complained about the price of the breakfast buffet, but we ordered off the menu, and the prices were reasonable (for a ski ).  re was also a good ski shop, which came in handy since someone in our group needed a neck gaiter. My only minor complaint would be about the Devil's Den.  Initially, we went there to get a few drinks and some food after we arrived on Saturday night, but the music was so obnoxiously loud, we didn't even get past the doorway.  I could have understood this, if the place had been packed with club goers, however there was a grand total of three people in the place.  
 skiing conditions were great.   brand new quad was running, and we could ski down Cyclops and right into the gate without having to wait at all to go up again.  As only half the mountain was open, I really can't give a complete review of the terrain, and since I am not a snow boarder, I can't comment on the terrain park. However, anyone who has skied out west or in the northeast will probably feel like the black diamonds are really just blue squares.  This is certainly not the fault of the    just a byproduct of living in the Midwest. Nor did it matter to those in our party who stuck to the blue and green runs.

8152,2011-01-04,Wisconsin,Whitecap Mountain,3,This is a beautiful ski hill with 43 trails.  It's never crowded and there always seems to be lots of snow.   lodge does have a huge hot tub.,Tahsha LePage
8153,2011-01-04,New Hampshire,Ragged Mountain,5,"Ragged Mountain is a gem.  place has a laid back, local yokel vibe with a friendly staff and surprisingly good terrain for its size. 

Snowmaking operations are not aggressive here (compared to larger s with bigger budgets and more staff) so normally 1 or 2 trails open at a time to get the season going.  cruisers are fun but if the groomed stuff is all that's available, you'll be done early.  ski patrol folks are cool but can take a while to check things out and drop the ropes   which can happen at any time of the day. and even when there's good snow on Cabin Fever and Big Rock, they may not be open because the trail you take from those runs to the base won't be ready. 

Once there is enough of a natural base, however, Ragged finally delivers.  steepest sections are often short but on a powder day I have found Raggae Glades, Birches, Sweepstakes and the gladed areas in the Ravine long enough and pitched just right to be plenty satisfying   especially for being so accessible. That's the best part: This is really the closest truly interesting, classic New England style skiing to Manchester and Boston. and while it's just on the opposite side of I 89 from Sunapee, Ragged Mountain is a world apart in the way it feels and the company it keeps.

It's funny how other reviewers have commented on the outdated signage and trails or lifts that don't exist. Ragged's relatively new ownership has pumped some money into the mountain and given it a face lift, but there are some simple fixes that haven't (yet) happened. In some ways, time has stood still here since the 's former life.  old Raggamuffins midway lodge sits dormant, and some signs mark runs that are always roped off, overgrown and supposedly forgotten about (Doug's Drop, Raggedy Ann, Devil's Den)   even if they're still on the map (Mikey's Run.) Not that you could get lost: there's only one base. 

Another nice thing about Ragged   any advanced skier will still enjoy the greens here, which have a few fun intermediate inclined drops (Cardigan) and good views. Don't pass up the Barnyard run with its ski through barn.

As for lifts:  six pack chair is great.  Spear triple is slow, but relax   the ride is worth it for Flying Yankee (wonderful cruiser but widened last season for racing), the double diamond rated entrances to the Ravine (when they're open   unfortunately rarely) and the short but sweet (albeit poorly marked) glades off of Cardigan.

 daily ticket prices are on par with larger s in the state but the mountain offers weekday deals, and the season pass is a great value.  lodge is comfortable and always seems spacious enough even when it's busy. Speaking of which, that's not too often: avoid the Saturday of MLK weekend. Other than that, you'll find racers here on the typical weekend day but they stick to one trail and the rest of the mountain, you'll probably have to yourself.

 two stars for ""Nightlife"" refer to the pleasant apres ski offerings in the second floor of the main lodge. Otherwise, there isn't much around for lodging, bars or restaurants. This is a simple skiers' mountain and I like it that way.

Ragged is completely unpretentious and still under the radar.  owners have big plans for it but these changes are happening slowly and I hope that the mountain can retain its character   becoming profitable for them without becoming another Loon. It's a special place and is one of those mountains that, when in full operation and blessed with good snow, offers a lot to be explored and enjoyed.",thowes
8154,2011-01-04,New Hampshire,Gunstock,3,A great day trip and easily accessible.  No crowds on weekdays and the Panorama quad chair lift is fast to the top.  Lots of trails for intermediate skiers/snowboarders that still offer a challenge in comparison with other large mountains.  I love it here for going a few times a week and they do a good job of grooming.  I highly recommend checking it out.  Especially great savings for passholders if you purchased pre season.,thowes
8155,2011-01-04,New Hampshire,Crotched Mountain,5,"Our family of 5, kids 6, 9 and 11 and my wife who dislikes cold, speed and bumps, had another great holiday week at Crotched Mountain.  Unforunately, my 9 year old took a bump too fast and twisted his ankle.  Able to ski to the lodge, my wife had him checked out by very attentive, knowledgable, friendly and helpful EMTs. Since he could not ski the rest of the day, and he had only had three runs, they refunded the two lift tickets on a gift card.  My two other kids and I skied the rest of the day, having a great time together.  After a day of rest, the five of us were back on the slopes, and we were able to ski the whole mountain (except UFO and Equinox trails that were steeps with moguls   dunno what the other review meant by saying there were no bumps   these two trails were definitely bumps.)  My wife could stay on Super nova and gain confidence, my 11 year old rider could gain some jib experience on the big jumps on the two parks, and my young skiers could challenge themselves from the top of the mountain.  

While experienced and highly skilled skiers would not find this mountain all that challenging, it was great for th efive of us   varied terrain, increasing difficulty of trails that included straight steeps and windy middle difficulty trails.   people were very nice, very few rude, wild or disrespectful skiers or riders and the staff were pleasant and experienced.  We travelled from outside of Philadelphia to New Hampshire for the kid's winter break, and made a point of returning to Crotched after our excellent experience last year.  We are probably getting to the point in our skiing skills (we all started about 5 years ago, but have not gone outside the Poconos and Crotched) that we will be graduating to bigger ski areas.  However, we heartily recommend Crotched for families of differing abilities.

 only draw back is the lodge   while clean, with tasty and reasonably priced food, it is spare, small and boring.  ",thowes

8167,2011-01-06,Wisconsin,Tyrol Basin,2,"You can not beat $12 lift tickets on Tuesdays.  snow was suprisingly still present on our sunny March visit, and overall the hill was better than expected.  3 main lifts seat 3 people each, and there were 2 tow ropes.  black diamonds were actually challenging, and the terrain park was terriffic! I should have taken advantage of the $12 beginner lessons for my two snowboarding compadres. re were too many swearing little kids though, which took away from the experience. Overall, would visit this hill again, especially on Tues! ",Tahsha LePage
8186,2011-01-09,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,3,"A Basin is one of the places we make sure we hit when in CO. It's got great terrain, good snow, and isn't an overly commercialized  like many of the other places in the area. If you're looking for an ""old school"" ski vibe, this place is it.

We hit A Basin on the 13 to get some early season turns in. A Basin was looking really well covered, but only one top to bottom run was open, with a few side runs open. Below the new triple chair, Lenawee Mountain Express, was a nice untracked run that was closed off. We waited anxiously while ski patrol marked obstacles, hoping for the untouched to become available. In the meantime, we lapped the main run. It was icy on top  probably because of the flat light and no one able to see where the terrain was  but after the first handful of turns, the snow got consistent again, and you could whip some high speed turns.

Eventually, the powder filled run under the chair became open: a ski patroller let a dozen people at a time get some untracked. It was the first time the area was open all season! We were the third group down, and knee deep, soft CO pow pow splashed up to our waist. We were in heaven! Two different pow runs in two days? On opening weekend?! I was floored. We lapped the powder run three times  all under the watchful eye of the A Basin ski patrol  until they closed it again. It was an awesome few runs.

Ski patrol then opened up the West Wall for a bit, so we went and got in line for a run down that.  snow was a little more wind blown and chopped pow, but still a fun run. We made one run, then headed home for the day.

A Basin has a lot of snow available, and with another storm or two, I think it's safe to say it's going to open up a lot more.",Dedmond
8187,2011-01-09,Colorado,Loveland,5,"Great ski trip to Loveland.  Snowed the entire time.  Lots of great terrain for experts and intermediates.  Did not ski any of the beginner runs so I am not sure how they are.   lift set up is well planned, with the exception of returning to the base from chair 8.  Due to snowy conditions most of the runs has 2 3 inches of powder so I am not sure how the grooming is.  Good prices and selection for lunch.  This is a local ski hill.  re is no lodging on the hill.  We stayed in Georgetown, about 12 miles to the ski hill and found some good spots to eat and stay.   wind can be strong at the top of the lifts and it can be cold at the top.  Traffic on I 70 was horrible!  It took an hour to go 12 miles.  This was due to snowy conditions near the tunnel so be aware. We had a great time and would ski at Loveland again.  Great choice if you do not want a  experience or crowds.",Dedmond
8196,2011-01-10,Michigan,Nubs Nob,5,"One thing is clear as soon as you arrive at Nub's: their business is snow.  Too many ski areas seem to forget that   real estate developments, swanky nightclubs, and indoor waterparks become their major attractions.  Not so for Nub's.  

Nub's offers a variety of terrain for all abilities   long, gentle green runs connect the three sets of slopes.  Mostly blue runs are found on the backside of the hill at ""Pintail Peak,"" and the front side features more challenging slopes.  Several glade runs of varying difficulty are also present, as well as a cross country ski trail.

 snow has always been in good shape when I have been there, which is saying a lot, in a part of the country that is infamous for its icy conditions.  

 lodge facilities are typical for a day skiing area   nothing fancy, but the food and bar are decent, and the lodge has Wi fi for people like me who can't help bragging about their awesome day to all their friends online.  People who want to spend the night close by will find overnight lodging options limited, but then again, Nub's is clearly not out to compete with the nearby Boyne s in this regard.  and to me, that's just fine.

8230,2011-01-15,West Virginia,Timberline Mountain,4,"My first skiing trip this year (2010 2011) was to Timberline the weekend of December 17 19. What a difference from previous Decembers! Last year, there was only 1 trail (plus the bunny) open.

8242,2011-01-16,Vermont,Sugarbush,4,"Let me start off by saying that this place is great, but not everyone will love it as much. If you are looking for a large variety of wide open cruisers, large snowmaking coverage, perfectly manicured trails, good terrain parks, and lots of beginner options, you are probably better off at places like Mt. Snow, Okemo, Stratton, Killington, Sunday River, or Stowe. That's not to say Sugarbush doesn't have those amenities: they just don't have as many wide open cruisers,  groom as much, have as much snowmaking coverage, and have as many beginner areas and terrain parks as those other places. If, however, you love glades, steeps, BIG vertical (for the east), variety, powder, and natural terrain and bumps, you will love this place. Think of it as a bigger Mad River Glen with more amenities and lodging, faster lifts, and slightly more options for beginners and intermediates, but not any less challenging. 

Terrain Options: 
    
     Beginners: Beginners don't have as much variety as some other places. For first timers, on Lincoln Peak, there is the Welcome Mat (magic carpet) and village double. re is also one green off of the Gate House express quad, but that's pretty much it. Over on Mt. Ellen, there is another beginner area, and some more greens higher up, but going up the mountain may be intimidating for newbies, so they can get bored pretty fast  thing about Sugarbush is once you have mastered their greens, it is a pretty big step up to their blues. Many of their blues would be blacks at a lot of other places in the East, which is why this place isn't as good for beginners.

     Intermediate: Decent intermediates have a lot of options, though again, the blues here are a step up from blues at other places. Some of the best on Gadd Peak (Superbravo Lift) are Snowball to Spring Fling (one of the few boulevards here), Murphy's Glade (really a trail with some trees dotting the middle), Birdland (under the lift), and lower organgrinder (black on the map, but one of the few blacks at Sugarbush that can be managed by intermediates). Off of the summit   of Lincoln Peak (Heaven's Gate Triple), there is Jester, a delightfully twisty groomer. Upper organgrinder is a lot tougher than lower, so I wouldn't recommend it to intermediates. Ripcord (under the Heaven's Gate lift) is a double black, but is occasionally groomed. When it is, it can be managed my a strong intermediate, and is uncharacteristically easy for a double black at Sugarbush. However, it is usually bumped up, and a lot tougher when it is. re is nothing on castlerock for intermediates, and the blacks and double blacks there are the real deal, so don't try to go there even if you are a budding advanced skier; there is a large warning sign at the bottom of the lift, so those who don't belong there don't have to worry about inadvertently ending up over there. Off of the Gate House quad, there are some nice blues, including Sleeper, a nicely treed groomer. Off of the North Lynx triple, there is Birch run, a nice sunny area, great for intermediate bumps. On Mt. Ellen, there are a couple of the boulevards that are sparse at Sugarbush, such as Cruiser, Rim Run, Which Way, Inverness, and Elbow. Try taking Rim Run from the top down the full 2,600 vert to the bottom lots of fun. One of the things I love about the blues at Sugarbush is that each has character, such as being narrow and having some trees dot it. 

     Advanced: This is where Sugarbush really shines. I'm not going to be as comprehensive as I was with Intermediates; I'm only going to talk about on map stuff, I am not giving up my stashes :)
Off of Superbravo, there is Stein's Run, which is wide, has some great bumps, and a perfect steep fall line pitch. y make a lot of snow on this trail, so this is one of the last trails to close at the end of the season. Up on Lincoln Peak, there is upper organgrinder, the old gondola line. It's steep, used to be groomed but not so much nowadays. Ripcord, the wide trail under the heaven's gate lift; it can sport some great bumps, but they groom it more than they used to: when groomed, it is easy. Paradise is a great somewhat treed run, but I wouldn't recommend doing it if it hasn't snowed for a while. Now we come to castlerock, the the section of the mountain I could swear was stolen from MRG. It is served by a slow, low capacity double, and a big, frankly worded sign at the bottom keeps the gapers away. Middle Earth and Castlerock run are fun and tough, but nothing compared to Liftline and Rumble. Liftline is steep with lots of cliffs to launch off of, but you can at least see its condition from the lift. Rumble, however, is one of the nastiest trails in the East. It has liftline's pitch, but is extremely twisty, much narrower, and has a lot of rocks, roots, and cliffs to negotiate. I would strongly recommend not doing this trail unless it is the deepest day of the year, you hate your skis, or you really REALLY know what you're doing. North Lynx has some nice bump runs, but nothing scary. Off of the summit of Mt. Ellen, you have Black Diamond and FIS: steep, bumpy, and often icy. Mt. Ellen has some of the best bumps in the east: I'm not going to mention every bump run on mount ellen because there are so many, but I will say the blacks on Ellen are tougher than on LP because they tend to groom more on LP. 

     Trees: Sugarbush is one of the best in the east for this, with 270 in of snow each year avg (not inflated like Stowe), and a large selection of glades, on trail and off trail.  only thing is that Sugarbush does not rate their glades, so for easier trees, try Eden on LP. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend trying your first tree run at Sugarbush; go to Killington, Sunday River, or Jay for that. 

     Park: Once again, this is not a good place for that, unless you consider natural terrain your park. re is one park on mount ellen, served by a double, but pales in comparison to Killington or Mt. Snow. 
 
     Families: This is not the best place for families with mixed abilities because they will not even be able to ride the lift with each other. at Stowe, for example, the quad serves every ability, so friends and family of different ability will be able to meet at the bottom and ride the lift together. at Sugarbush, different lifts serve different abilities for the most part, so families will not be able to be with each other while skiing or riding. Families with park enthusiasts, again, will not be happy here.   

Other things about the :
re are lots of lodging options, ranging from the ritzy (and expensive) Clay Brook hotel, to affordable condos, to bargain inns. I have heard that their ski school is great. Lift tickets are expensive, and on the rise due to base area expansions.  cheaper mount ellen only ticket is not really worth it, unless you are a local, because a lot of the best terrain is on LP. IMPORTANT: When they put up a thin cover sign, there is always a reason here. Sugarbush tends to be conservative about closing trails, as they don't make as much snow or groom as much as some other places. Trails here marked with a simple lollipop ""Thin Cover"" sign would almost certainly be closed anywhere else, and you really don't want to be ducking any closed ropes here. re is 2000 acres of backcountry in the slide brook basin, but I wouldn't recommend going there unless you're with someone who has been there before, or with one of the guided tours. Watch out for moose in there!  people here for the most part are very friendly, from friendly chairlift conversations (not found at Killington) to the extremely helpful customer service. You won't find the arrogant vibe of MRG skiers here.   lift system is great, with 5 high speed quads and slower lifts servicing the summits. I like that, because you are not committed to skiing top to bottom, if there is better snow up high or down low, and if wind closes the upper lifts (which it often does here) you can still ski the lower mountain, unlike some other places (*cough* stowe). Also, it keeps the crowding at the top down.  

I hope this has been helpful (if you are still awake by now)!",Kase1
8252,2011-01-18,Pennsylvania,Liberty,4,"For the location, this  is good choice, like most it can get icy at night.  3 quad lifts   Alpine feeds the west side of mountain, with midline stop for terrain park riders to exit lift, this lift gets crowded.  

Better option for intermediate and more experinced riders is to go to the east side of the mountain and use the 2 quads Eastwind and Strata.  Eastwind seems to get more crowded than Strata, with easy access to Strata and Sidewinder trails.  

As an intermediate skier, the east side offers a good mix of Blues and more expert runs,  Side winder offers a lot of options by linking to lower blue terrain on Eastwind,Strata, and Ultra runs.

Overall, good experience will be back with Snowbaording sons for a early am 4 hour flex. ",andy D

It's also unique in the fact that the main chalet is at the top of the hill, so you start your day skiing rather than riding a lift.  

Anyone can enjoy the hill  children (they have a 'magic carpet' instead of rope tow); beginner (plenty of greens with easy to read signage); intermediate (lots of hills with blue ratings); advanced (great terrain park, some moguls, headwalls, etc.)

8275,2011-01-19,Ohio,Boston Mills and Brandywine,1,"Everybody says that Brandywine is not good for skiers, and I'm not sure why.  True, the runs are shorter than Boston Mills, and with its big terrain parks, the area is obviously geared to the boarder crowd, but as a traditional downhill skier, I find that I prefer Brandywine.

First off, the snow is generally in better shape.  I think a big part of this is that Brandywine does not get as much daytime use, when the snow is softest and most vulnerable.  Also, even though there are a lot of club buses in the lot on weekends, the area does not seem nearly as crowded.   lift lines are certainly more manageable.

But I think the emphasis on the terrain parks plays into skiers' hands, too.  Because many of the boarders spend their time riding rails and playing on the jumps, there is less traffic on the other slopes.  I enjoy Grizzly, and its next door neighbor, Shredder.  Between these slopes are various changes in angle and contour that are fun to ski in various ways.  

All in all, Brandywine is a decent place.  and the deal is especially good when you consider that a lift ticket also gives you access to Boston Mills, as the two s are owned by the same company. ",stuck_in_614
8276,2011-01-20,New Hampshire,Bretton Woods,5,"I am 15 years old, what most older skiers would call part of the terrain park loving generation.  I visited in mid March with my parents, who had skied before, but not extensively.  We stayed in the Lodge at Bretton Woods, and found no problem with it, as it catered to our needs well, meeting the standard.   internet is not free however.  I cannot review the nightlife or the food extensively because each night my mom would cook Chinese noodles for the three of us (we're Chinese).
 base lodge is the type you would find at most other New England s, nothing overly fancy, with the normal fare on the ground floor, and the fancier stuff on the second floor.  It was mainly just the strap your stuff on and hit the slopes type lodge, not many people just hanging out in them.
 beginner slopes are some of the best in New England.  For starters, the bunny slope is actually two adjacent trails, served by a short quad chair with a small tree slalom/little bunny glade directly underneath the lift (my parents skiied there most of the time).
 main high speed quad, the Bethlehem Express Quad, is located directly in front of the base lodge to the side of the Bretton's Wood trail, which is a show off trail which people skiing down can be seen by everyone in the base lodge.  One note about this trail is that it's quite steep for a green trail, and should not be the trail that people just coming off the bunny hill should ski.  Instead that type should ski the Big Ben trail to the right.  That being said, there are many green trails and blues which should be rated green around the mountain, especially on the main face.  Another note is that Bretton Woods states that they have 101 trails.  y don't really have 101 trails though.  Many of these are traverses, connectors, and glades which are so close together they shouldn't be counted as trails.  With those three out of the picture, Bretton Woods actually offers 60 legitimate trails.
Many of the trail markings are also very inaccurate.  Joseph's Run (blue) coming off of West Mountain is as steep as Zealand trail (black), the run which cuts below the Rosebrook Summit Quad, just below Bode's Run (probable steepest normal trail).  Two Miles Home is also a green until about 80% of the way back, when there is one drop.
If you are an advanced skier, your best bet is the Rosebrook Canyon Glades in between Deception Bowl (black) and Two Miles Home, as well as Bode's Run and MacIntyre's Ride which are adjacent to each other underneath the summit quad.  Waumbek on West Mountain offers the longest continuous steep drop in the .  Beware, if you ski West Mountain, unless you  collect enough momentum, you will face a long arduous traverse back to the main area via the Crawford Ridge traverse.  When my dad first went to the top, this section took away most of his energy.  Some of the other glades are very steep too, such as Devil's Den off Bode's Run, and Inferno and the canyon glades.  re are three terrain parks usually in operation on the average day, as the bunny slope terrain park did not exist at my time there.   one on Bretton's Wood offers nice medium sized jumps on a shallow slope to go along with the usual works (box, rails), while the Coo's Caper terrain park offered somewhat large jumps on more steeper terrain.   third terrain park, Wild West, is located in the Peppersass Glade.  It's pretty neat, as it has a couple little rails made of wood.
Overall my family had a great time skiing at Bretton Woods.  at the beginning I was a low intermediate, but by the end I was probably low expert, meaning on the last day most of the trails started to bore me a little.  But a great experience overall.",Alan M

We had much more fun skiing at Caberfae y have some pretty steep and challenging runs but in the areas where the blues combine with the greens one must use caution. re were several near collisions while we were skiing. But they have some nice options for creating interesting runs with a little planning before you head downhill. I'm a little old and brittle for terrain parks, and there didn't appear to be much to choose from in that respect. We did have three or four instances of confrontations with teenage snowboarders being extremely rude and very mouthy, but you have that everywhere anymore. One slight oddity is the dangerous path you have to take to get from the North Peak to the South Peak. You basically have to cross in midhill a few of the fastest runs to get to the chair and it's not much of a vertical while you're doing it. So you're kind of hung out going slowly across while others are flying downhill at you. It's either that or take a black run through a narrow tree lined trail. But the prices were outstanding and the reception staff made sure we were getting the best rate possible as there are a few different combinations. Also, we had an incident that resulted from an oversight by the maintenance staff and when we brought it to the General Manager's attention, He quickly and kindly made everything right much to our satisfaction.  lodging was good and we really enjoyed the balcony for our room as we had a view of the hills and most of the . y allowed us to bring a cooler to our room and we used it as a fridge on the balcony where we kept our supplies.  pool and hot tub are a fun addition and very relaxing after a long day on the slopes. We will go back and I recommend Caberfae to folks who simply love to ski. ",Ktown
8281,2011-01-20,New York,Gore Mountain,4,"I was there in 2009 and the snow making was atrocious.  It improved somewhat in 2010 but still needs improvement.  Staff had a union mentality.  However, the hill is good   great on the upper part of the mountain.  Takes a while to get there but it is worth it for skiing.  Having said that, there is a dearth of accommodations and the nightlife is not for singles unless you bring a date (maybe because it is in the middle of nowhere.)  Good Hill for the purists. I know it is in a State Park, but if it was better developed, it could be a first class destination.  As it stands, it is too far to go unless you are in a race or have a family and want good skiing but a quiet vacation.  I said nightlife is poor only because for the distance traveled, if that is what you are looking for, it is certainly not worth it.",loricipheran

I traversed over to another trail stated as a trail with ""great banked turns"" but it wasn't banked or had any turns either. It seemed like it was a 200 foot drop at a very low pitch and then it was flat/uphill the rest of the way. ir black diamonds didn't look steep at all, maybe a blue anywhere else in New Hampshire and a blue/green in the rockies.  parking was in a mud pit.

8314,2011-01-23,Vermont,Stowe Mountain,5,"When I went, only a few miles of blue trails on the main Mt. Mansfield were open and the beginners’ area on Mt. Spruce, but they were excellent condition with great snow, and were quite challenging. Sadly the Gondola area was unable to open due to high winds.
In the afternoon, Spruce Peak opened its trails.
 ski school would not sell me a lesson package as they told me we would take too long to get across the  to the operating lifts (as the cross over gondola was closed due to high winds)and I would not get value for money – this was refreshingly honest and seems typical of the town and ’s attitude.   had also warned me well in advance of coming to Stowe that only a proportion could be expected to be open so early in the season, so I was not all disappointed, in fact very pleased with my visit and look forward to returning again.

What was open were beautiful runs through trees, excellent and friendly service and some stunning scenery. We stayed down in the lovely town at the Green Mountain Inn – I would definitely recommend it.

8315,2011-01-23,Vermont,Killington,5,"     Simply put, Killington Vermont is one of the best s within a day's drive of half the U.S. population. With 6 mountains plus another  called Pico that can be ridden with the same lift ticket, you are looking at a week's worth of riding without hitting the same run twice.  long groomers are incredible, such as Great Eastern, which takes a good 20 minutes top to bottom, and that is riding fast.  steep runs here are incredible, except for the few that don't get groomed (however this is subject to opinion as I am a snowboarder and don't enjoy moguls). re is plenty of different black and double black terrain that will make your legs burn.   canyon area is awesome for this type of riding, with steep groomed runs, trees and park all right there.
      terrain parks here are awesome, complete with any feature that you've ever hit. Worth noting is the Stash, which is a unique park made entirely out of natural material. y can take awhile to open these parks however, so checking the website (killington.com) helps if you are planning a trip around this.
     Many people end up complaining about the price of a lift ticket (around 84 USD on weekends), but when you look around at all that Killington has to offer, you really can't complain, as this price has become the norm at many large scale mountains. and besides, we went last week for 50 dollars a day by purchasing tickets from an online lift ticket site. But definitely bring your own food, unless you enjoy paying ten bucks for a turkey burger, fries not included.
     All in all, I have never left Killington unsatisfied. As long as around 100 trails are open (usually by early January) you will never get bored, between tree riding, long groomers, steeps and parks. If you are a serious skier/rider and do not have a set destination for your next trip, I strongly recommend looking into Killington. You won't regret it.",R Lee Stump
8317,2011-01-23,Ohio,Snow Trails,2,"Snow Trails has come to be my favorite ski area in Ohio.  y make the most of what they have.  What really strikes me about the area is the quality of the snow.  I can spend one day at Boston Mills/Brandywine contending with icy slopes, and then drive down here, skiing on fluffy groom the very next day.  Part of this may be the climate   the Mansfield area often has the lowest temperatures in the state   but I also suspect that the grooming is better.  I also appreciate the scenic qualities of the area.    is in a pleasant, wooded setting, and even has a few small glade runs.

Any ski area in Ohio is prone to getting crowded, but I have never seen a day so crowded at Snow Trails that I was compelled to leave.  Even on a busy day, the Silver lift, down by the tubing park, usually offers a minimal wait.  

 slopes at Snow Trails are not very challenging, but being Ohio, that should come as no surprise.  But when I want a dose of winter fun that is close to home, Snow Trails fills the bill for me.",stuck_in_614

Hyland also has a large terrain park which is a negative for me because it attracts tons of rude teenage snowboarders who leave their energy drink cans all over the place and cuss everybody out. Why does my ski team have to meet here at this bunny hill? My advice to you: Take a longer drive, spend some more money, and visit Afton or Welch. Those are the best alternatives in the St Paul area.

I skied there on 3 occasions in the evening (after 4:00) and at times, it felt like I had the mountain to myself. Skiers seems to be more laid back and considerate than at other s. My only beef is with the slow service at the rental shop. On my last visit, though there were only 2 people on front of us, it took close to 30 minutes before we could finally hit the snow.  employees looked like they were bored out of their minds. My rental skis where very dull, I could probably have swapped them.",Henry Hartley

8326,2011-01-24,Wisconsin,Alpine Valley Wisconsin,4,"Consider where this is... kind of sandwiched between 2 major metro centers, in a part of the country which is mostly flat and receives little natural snow.  So, basically, the odds are stacked against this place to provide quality skiing, but they do a good job with what they have.

re are 2 high speed quads (contrary to the other user who claimed there aren't any  I swear there are!) which keep people chugging up the hill at a good pace.  When it gets more crowded, they open up some other fixed grip lifts to supplement.  at that point, the slopes are going to be sheer madness, so if you go on a weekend or holiday, don't complain  you've been warned.  During the week you can get lots of runs in quick because the lift ride is so fast.

Vertical is just shy of 400, which isn't spectacular but it's by far the biggest you'll find south of Devil's Head.   ""black diamond"" runs aren't that steep but they do go top to bottom unlike at some other places (cough*Cascade*cough) and will provide good fun for intermediates.  Blues are no steeper than greens...and they're pretty darn flat, so I guess this would be a good spot for novices.  

Prices are steeper than the slopes on weekends, but they have good deals during the week.  y make a LOT of snow, which is an expensive proposition, so don't whine about it  you wouldn't be able to ski here if they didn't do it.

My only gripe  January and still no moguls?  Come on  you've been open since November!  Can't speak to the hotel or nightlife as this is a day trip for me, which is the real draw  It's the biggest hill less than a hundred miles drive from Chicago...I can get up early, get a good skiing workout, and be home by 5.  If you want that, you'll get it.  If you want a full  experience for a weekend trip, I highly suggest Devil's Head (although I hear mixed reviews of their hotel, might want to stay in town) or head the other way and go to Michigan.",Mark Fortin
8327,2011-01-24,Wisconsin,Cascade Mountain,5,"Cascade is great for what it is...  A 700 foot mountain!   cost of the lift is the same as you will get anywhere in Wisconsin, however the food is very expensive.   good news is that you can bring your own food!

Lots of terrain for all levels to work on technique.  I know that all the little people care about is terrain parks and there are 3 areas set up for this type of rider.  

 snow is always in good shape in the am and then begins to deteriorate towards the end of the day (Like any place that is mostly man made snow).  

On my last trip I had no issues with the snow or even the crowd.  I was there on a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly crowded however at all of the most popular lifts they had a person directing who was up next and this really kept the flow of people moving instead of people being rude and cutting in line.

8339,2011-01-26,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,3,"Two friends and I drove to Blue Mountain from NYC on Sunday   we wanted to do a day trip to someplace close since 2/3 of us had work the next day. All and all it was a great day despite the crowds. None of us had ever been here before   but we've all skied a couple small PA/NJ/NY mountains, so we knew not to expect Vermont. I was skiing and my friends were snowboarding. We range from advanced beginner to intermediate.

Bad stuff: It was crowded, and even though we got there at 1:00, we had only done two runs by 4:00. We had a few time sucking problems with our rental equipment.  lift line system (they separate people into 2s, 3s, 4s, and singles) was confusing / unclear because it was impossible to see the tiny signs in the insane MLK crowds. We should have just gotten night (4pm closing) tickets and hung out by the fire until then.

Good stuff: Half the crowd left after 4, and suddenly we noticed that this is actually a pretty fun little mountain!  far left / Valley Lodge side was great for us   Paradise is a long and surprisingly satisfying green cruiser, and was wide enough to accommodate lots of people. It was also really nice to be able to branch off of that onto the blue Dreamweaver and meet back up with my friends easily, since I didn't want to totally go off by myself all day. For such a busy weekend, conditions stayed decent until around 9:15pm, at which point the bottom of Dreamweaver turned into a hockey rink. I saw a few people bite it pretty hard on that giant ice patch. It's also worth mentioning that the teenagers here seemed way less psycho than at Mountain Creek and Camelback   in fact, most of the people seemed pretty chill/nice.

 mountain is split in two sides, and it's kind of hard to switch between them.  Summit Lodge side is worth checking out for Lazy Mile & Switchback or any of the blacks   but on a crowded day, the relatively narrow green Burma Road is about the worst trail ever   every curve had about 30 sitting noobie snowboarders, making it impossible to get through. My green snowboarder buddies were super frustrated after one run and headed right back to Paradise. 

Anyway, we'd probably come back for a day trip in a year or so. We all loved having a beer and sitting at the fire pits, and the blacks looked like they'd be fun when we get better.

We were dreading the long queues and crowded slopes over the MLK weekend, but were pleasantly surprised, for the most part, at the mountain's efficient operations and to an extent it's beginner friendly demeanor. Some tips/comments that would help you with the decision making/visit to the mountain
  GO to Shawnee ONLY if you are looking for a kid/beginner friendly operation. Otherwise you WILL be disappointed.
  Try the Beginner package (book online at liftopia) as it includes a lift pass, equipment rental, and a beginner/intermediate class
  Get there early   mountain opens at 8 AM, take a afternoon break to catch lunch and maybe a nap, and get back to the slopes around 5 PM. 8AM   10AM and 5PM+ were the best times.
  Use the lockers at the Trepp lodge as they are electronic and allow multiple access during the day.
  If you need ski gear, shop at the ski shop at the mountain. Contrary to what we know, the shop had the best deals, not to mention a decent selection, on sunglasses, helmets, base layers, liners, gloves, etc..etc... made me kick myself over spending hours locally trying to find these.

8345,2011-01-26,Pennsylvania,Elk Mountain Ski,4,"Despite offering an expensive season pass, skiing Elk is still a tremendous value with the 4 hour morning weekday lift ticket at $36.  What you get are very well maintained trails on probably the best terrain that you will find in the mid atlantic states area.  While geography might limit the quality and quantity of natural snow, they do a fantastic job of making it and keeping it expertly groomed (they do it far better than comparably sized s farther north).  I do not encounter ice nearly as much as elsewhere (e.g. Greek Peak). Situated on what most folks out west would call a foothill, Elk Mountain's trails are thoughtfully laid out maximizing the skiing possibilities.  From fast, steep,  & straight shots to twisty turny rambles there is enough to variety to please most skiers. (and there are plenty of bumps, too).   lift drop offs are nicely situated so that you do NOT have to skate uphill to get to trailheads (an obvious feature that so many NE ski s seem to maddeningly overlook!) 

I see some folks have complained about the ""slow"" lifts but here is my take on this:  You won't find any high speed flashy painted gondolas but all of the lifts seem to be very well maintained.  re is one quad on the west side of the mountain but it's not considered a ""high speed"".  Lift lines are usually not very long and even on it's busiest days do not seem move quickly.  I would dread the addition of ""faster"" lifts because if you move too many people up the mountain too quickly, that translates into too many skiers on the trail at any one time.  I kinda like how things are now.  Speculation on my part. 

 facilities and lodge are certainly  quality.  restaurant serves very good food and the bar has a decent selection of booze (bar is cash only).      

re is no real nightlife to speak of in this remote section of PA unless you want to travel to Scranton.  However, only 3 minutes away, there is a honkey tonk called Chet's Place for burgers and beers.   beautiful Stone Bridge Inn is nearby for those who prefer finer drinks and dining.",Jackson

It has 1300 ft. vertical and, while not a mega mountain by anyone's standards, it is a fun place to go on a warm evening.  

To be sure, the ambiance is youthful, and there seemed to be way more boarders than skiers, but everyone was having a great time.  and, once again, the price can't be beat.

8381,2011-01-31,Vermont,Sugarbush,3,"So me and one of my buddies took a trip to Sugarbush on presidents week last year.  We chose Sugarbush cause we figured that Killington, Mt Snow, Okemo, etc would have the city crowds (which we're a part of, coming from NY) and since ' Bush was a lil further north maybe it would have a smaller crowd. 

We parked immediatley, got our tickets and were strapping on our skis at the lift within 10mins of leaving my buddies car... Coprrection 15mins, we did check our stuff into a locker.  But presidents week and NOBODY was on line to get the lift, from there we KNEW this was our mountain. 

We usually ski Mountain Creek formerly Vernon Valley in NJ, so our crowd we're used to is, ummm 'different'.   people at Sugarbush were overly friendly and helpful especially when they heard we've never been there before, I dunno if its how things are done in VT, but it was refreshing

 terrain.... Hands down some of the best Ive skied, especially when you throw in the ridiculously short lift lines hell that may make it THE best.   glades were varied from super dense forest to nice wide open lanes that were reminiscent of cruising on the expressway.  We got REAL deep into the woods and I gotta say, other than the fact that they have bears up there when we took a 'smoke' break during a deep glade run it was def the most picturesque mountain Ive ever skiied 

...and if you like secluded mountains (which is what we wanted after skiing Mountain Creek NJ all season) this is the spot for you.  I cant wait to go up again

When the lines did get long they just had a big blob of people with staff yelling to try and get people queued up.... it was a bit of a mess relative to many places.   A bit of extra rope and some stakes would do wonders.  

Waiting a bit to get on the lift is one thing on a normal mountain, but honestly a 'normal' ski will get you to the bottom of these slops in about 1.5 mins so, combined with the slow lifts, that can work out to a lot of waiting relative to the amount of skiing.   

All that said, it's the only option in the area if so you're looking to treat a case of the ski bug it provides for a fun day on the slopes.  y call it a ""Mountain Resort"" but honestly that's a bit over ambitious.  It's a nice family friendly local ski hill.",tom travis

I like the new lockers where you can have unlimited access for a fee (for the big lockers   $6 which is a little steep, but if youre going to be in/out of the locker the duration of the day its worth it) One down note was the new ""Sidewinder"" trail   it totally blows. I was stoked to try out this new run. Yes its an easy green   but dude...after the good first dip you hit major flat lands!!! no joke   i had to unstrap and skate to get to the next drop! In short i really had a great time today   the weather warmed up so it did make the snow a little slushy, but no one has control over that. A great escape for the day on the mountain. This place is good for die hard snowboarders and skiers and familes too.",tom travis
8396,2011-02-03,Utah,Snowbird,4,"For strong riders, Snowbird is hard to beat.  re is a ton of great terrain and if you know where to go you can have some epic runs.  re is so much in fact, that after a storm it can sometimes take several days before ski patrol has everything safe enough to ride (open).  This can be frustrating if you get up there only to find that your favorite areas are still closed.  Snowbird is also very popular which leads to bigger crowds than some s (Brighton) and runs getting tracked out very quickly.   tram line can be horrendous at times and I would recommend avoiding it.  All in all, it is a great mountain and if you don't mind a bit of a crowd I strongly recommend it (aside from the terrain park).",RidersProject
8399,2011-02-04,New York,Kissing Bridge,4," Downhill Terrain rating is a really tough one because it all depends upon what you're looking for. Is it variety ? Is it plenty of slopes for beginners ? Is it plenty of designated mogul fields ?. For me it's SPEED. and you can't have speed without steep slopes. Kissing Bridge doesn't have any steep slopes. That's a ""make it or break it"" thing for me. and so I won't be going back. If you're a speed adict like me, mark this place down as Too Tame, Go Elsewhere. and if you're looking for moguls, it had only the bottom section of one shallow slope with very small bumps and apparently not much potential to have much more. Don't want to knock the place tho. It has alot of good points. You'll read them in the other reviews here.

8402,2011-02-04,Vermont,Killington,4,"I used to avoid Killington as the prices, crowds and quality of snow did not live up to the hype.  Revisiting Killington this Thanksgiving made me re think my opinion.  Ok, the prices are still above average but the improvements the new owners have made in the past three years are right on the money.

First and foremost, coming from the West they used to think it was OK to wait for snow but now they're doing it right early season with some phenomenal snowmaking.  trails they had open for Thanksgivng were great in terms of variety and challenge... OK, no double blacks but that would be asking a bit much.  Nice work!

Apres ski, the village, or strip is a better term, offers more variety and quality than just about any NE .  You want it, they got it... from the happy hour crowds at the Wobbly Barn to the kids... try  Onion.

I have not skied there at night, but nearly all of the slopes appear to be lighted. re is a wide, pretty view to the east and north from the summit, which includes the skyline of Harrisburg and ridges and valleys.   lodge is spacious and pleasant and the staff are friendly.

8445,2011-02-11,Colorado,Winter Park,5," website promised discounts that were not available. It was not simply ambiguous sales talk  it was simply wrong.
When I called the 800 number they said discount tickets are available at any King Soopers or Safeway. I called nearly every one in Denver and they did not have discount tickets. Winter Park had not downloaded the tickets to any stores yet.  free shuttle from the town of Winter Park is nice except that it drops you off a half mile from the chair lift. Do developers think it is good for sales to have upset people walking past their stores in ski boots? at the end of the day you do the same painful walk back to the shuttle. That ruins the experience for many  especially beginners. gondola is silly because it takes you nowhere near the chairlift.
 mountain is great but why do developers think they can heard people like cattle to make a sale? All it does is anger people. I love the mountain but hate the corporate manipulations at the bottom. ",R Lee Stump

8462,2011-02-14,West Virginia,Snowshoe Mountain,5,"I went up to Snowshoe with 3 friends (we're all seniors in college) for MLK weekend.  I was expecting a typical eastern mountain, low quality and diversity of trails, over crowded, and other negative qualities  I was wrong.   conditions were amazing, the lifts were fairly empty because there are so many, and the terrain parks were solid.  I'm a fairly advanced skier and I was with 3 snowboarders (one of which was a beginner) and there was something great for all of us.  I suggest getting there at 9, when the lifts open.  Plenty of places for beginners / families, but for those who are advanced or just looking for the best trails, I suggest hitting the Western Territory as early as you can.  se are the longest / steepest trails.  Shae's revenge is gorgeous, and has a very steep grade as the end of the trail.  Silver Creek is about 2 miles from the main mountain and you can catch a shuttle over there.  It is known for night skiing, but if you go around lunch time it should be nice and empty :) On Silver creek, work your way to the right side of the mountain (if your looking at the trail map) Flying Eagle is fantastic, but a tad short.  Also, there is plenty of opportunity for creating your own trails through the trees / powder if that's your thing :)  jumps on the terrain park are very well made and had little ice.  All in all, one of the best experiences I've had in the East.  Only complaint is the lifts are slow! and the main mountain closes at 4:15, wish is was open later!",andy D
8463,2011-02-14,Maine,Sugarloaf,4,"I will preface this by saying I have not yet ridden at either Jay Peak or Stowe, widely regarded as 2 of the best in the East, but to this point, Sugarloaf is by far the best Eastern slope I've had the pleasure of riding.  

I made it to Sugarloaf on 2 occasions last year, once in January and once in March.  Both times, conditions were immaculate, with a groomed New England base, and loads of loose snow on top.   snowfields were open for the March trip, and were worth the trip alone, if only for the experience of riding above tree line.  Lifts are fast and efficient, though a base to summit Gondola, directly in place of the old one, would be a very welcome addition. 

Top to bottom rides can last 20 25 minutes on the cruiser intermediate trails.   views are amazing, spanning at least 3 states, and visibility into Canada from the summit.

 food is amazing, especially at  Bag, which is a great spot for an on the slopes lunch OR apres ski.  village itself makes up for the less than great nightlife, though there are a few decent pubs and restaurants in the Carrabbasett Valley as well.  Make no mistakes about it though.  If you're coming to Sugarloaf, you come to ski/board first, party second.

I haven't a bad thing to say about this mountain.  If I could give the downhill terrain 7 stars, I would.  As good as Sunday River is, Sugarloaf is 10x better, and well worth the trip into the remote Maine wilderness.",beachbumltj

8481,2011-02-16,Pennsylvania,Liberty,3,"Finally had a chance to ski with my 17 year old nephew and his stepfather on a Friday in January. Very light crowds until about 11AM. Conditions were pretty normal for Ski Liberty  inch or two of granular on top of some groomed ice. No complaints  I knew what I was in for as this is the  closest to home.  trails are fun  with the double black Upper Ultra being about 50 feet of awesome steepness! Even though it's short  it's still a rush hitting the fall line.  parks were in great shape  we did a few jumps, just to humble myself that I could still fall. We had the place nearly to ourselves. I am pretty sure there were more Ski School people in the morning than paid customers. Around 11:00, that all changed but it wasn't too bad. If the back side lines got long, we'd do the blacks on the front side. I really like the way the back side is set up so that you can start on any trail at the top, and cut over and do just about any other trail on the bottom.  staff was very friendly.

8482,2011-02-16,Pennsylvania,Roundtop Mountain,3,"Took my son and Godson to Roundtop, along with a friend and her son.  boys had free passes and their own equipment. I had my Advantage discount card. My friend didn't have rentals or discount. So, she paid about $100 for rentals and lift tickets just for one person. Kinda steep prices but it's a supply and demand economy and there's enough demand around to get those prices.

My son signed up for a freestyle clinic to try out his new twin tips. He worked hard and learned a few things and had fun. I may bring him back a few more times this month to do some more clinics. 

 skiing was surprisingly good. A nice granular surface over the packed powder (ice) made skiing fun  but not super fast. I wish they would groom all of Minuteman, which is the widest intermediate trail at the place. y leave half of the top ungroomed. y already have 4 trails with moguls  not sure if they're too lazy to groom it or if people really want a little more moguls on the ""beginner"" intermediate slope.  rest of the blue and black trails were less crowded and in fine shape. Lift lines weren't very bad  that's why we always ski on Superbowl Sunday (who won, anyway?).  staff there is young but polite and helpful. My son's clinic instructor was very thorough discussing with me the things they had gone over. Much better than the beginner lesson they gave to my daughter last year.

8483,2011-02-16,Pennsylvania,Whitetail,3,"Whitetail is my second favorite PA ski area, after Elk.

8488,2011-02-16,Washington,Crystal Mountain Washington,5,"Crystal is about a 90 minute drive from my home so I've been here several times over the past few years. This year they've added a new gondola and an RFID ticketing system.

Crystal is ski area, not a . WA state does not have anything resembling the big s you'll find in other Western states. We're too granola. Most people here are rightfully day trippers. re's very few amenities within even a reasonable driving distance. It's on US Forest Service land just outside Mt. Rainier National Park and it seems like every improvement must go through a lengthy government review process. I'm fine with all that because I come here to ski until I drop, not vacation.

Crystal has average terrain for beginners, and intermediates but I think it beats other ski areas in WA for having a ton of advanced terrain. Three bowls (Campbell, Avalanche, Silver) off the ""High Campbell"" chair are all double blacks and on entire swaths of mountain untouched by lifts. Powder Bowl, another double black, is very long and steep   scary to look at even from the bottom. Snorting Elk bowl and nearby terrain is an explorer's paradise   there's much more to be had there than you'd know from the official trail map. Basically there are a few designated runs there but everything is in bounds and fair game. n there's the Northway   this entire area is black or double black bowls, trees, and runs. Northway can be a challenge between snow dumps because you'll be dealing with moguls top to bottom, but then it's always empty. I rarely see more than a couple of people on the way down.

Crystal added a base to almost top gondola this year. It's a fantastic addition for intermediate skiers because it's now much more practical to enjoy most of Crystal's respectable vert (3100') all in one run. Take any number of blues from the top of the gondola down to mid mountain where you can then choose from either blacks, blues, or greens to get the rest of the way back down to the gondola base. Previously you'd have to take 2 chairs to get back to the top, with a 2 minute traverse between the chairs and the added wait in line. It just wasn't worth the time and effort. Now you just take the gondola. It's much faster and far more convenient. For people who really like the loooooong runs you get on a big mountain like Whistler this is the only thing in WA state that comes close.

 new ticketing system is great. You purchase your first ""ticket"" at the window. y actually give you an RFID card   like a credit card   that you keep in a pocket. It transmits a radio signal to gates at the lift that then let you through. On subsequent visits you don't have to wait in line at the ticket office   prior to leaving home you just purchase another day of skiing on their web site and your RFID card lets you through the gate again. You get a small discount for this advance purchase as well.

Crystal has some cons. My first thought its that it probably has the most expensive lift ticket in the WA state and charges a $5 premium for gondola access. Spent $73+tax a couple of weeks ago. This seems ridiculous to me. It's more than I have to spend to ski Whistler. 

Second thought is that the beginner and intermediate terrain can get very crowded because there's not enough of it.  Forest Queen lift lines can be long on weekends   this chair serves the best beginner runs and the only terrain park so it gets packed. On the plus side, there are chairs that usually have little or no wait because they don't serve any beginner terrain   Green Valley and Northway are often wide open.

Another thought I have is with the visibility here. It seems like some areas a prone to getting very cloudy   especially between Silver Queen and Grubstake Point. I can recall several occasions where flat light and ""fog"" became outright dangerous. I couldn't see and features on the ground, and had to slow down to avoid suddenly crashing into people emerging from the mist. It helps to check the web cams if you want to avoid this. re are plenty of times I've been here where it isn't a problem. It's hit and miss.

Final thought I want to raise is layout.  Avalanche Basin and Silver Basin are very difficult to access and therefore impractical to ski multiple times in a day. Part of me wishes they would add lift access to these areas. Another layout issue is that most of the hill below the Green Valley lift is skiable only by double blacks, long bumpy traverses, and a crap blue trail called ""Kelley's Gap Road"". This is a typical switchbacking, narrow, flat run that makes otherwise advanced terrain accessible to intermediates. I think Crystal could do a little better on this part of the mountain. It feels neglected. Final layout issue is that it's a bit difficult to get over to Northway without either a traverse or so a short uphill. On top of that the runs there get so bumpy between snow dumps   it would be great if they could groom some of it so you aren't burning out your legs the entire way down if it's later in the day and you're getting tired but still want to be in that area.",Ross Bretherton
8492,2011-02-17,Vermont,Okemo Mountain,3,"Okemo is, at first, a great mountain with tons of terrain and good snow and all that. But after about two days, you'll find yourself getting very bored on the mountain since most of the ""blacks"" tend to be larger cruisers, which are fun some of the time. So if you really want steep, Okemo's not great. Howerver, if you're going skiing with the little ones, Okemo is great! Lots of terrain is ideal for little children to learn on, and improve n all that. 
re are of course good things! Like the grooming is very good. y picked good trails to keep the bumps on, and good trails to groom; they never dissapointed. and the snow making was pretty good as well. Most of the trails had very good coverage, with only a few rocks and trees poking out. That wasn't the case on places like the South Face or the glades. My skiis had bumps and scratches all over them cuz of rocks and logs. I really wish they would get rid of some of those rocks....
 staff are really nice, the food was ok (though horribly expensive, a normal lunch for two can range in the $40's), the snow is usually good, btu there are too many children and rocks and crowds for any special experience.  slopes get pretty icy and bad by noon or so by the way with the crowds.

We skiid on weds and thurs so there wasn't any wait at any of the lifts and they even had a $20 lift ticket special that lasted the entire week !! You have to hike about a half mile to ski the upper end of the cathedral trail and it is well worth it if it is open(this trail is all natural) !!  only negatives I can think of for this  is that the internediate trails would be considered beginner trails at most s and the beiginner trails are more like baby trails. If you're an advanced skier don't waste your time with anything other than single and double diamond trails and the excellent glades.This is not a party , there are very few bars and hotels nearby so it is for the serious skiers only but the conditions are ten times better than Hunter.....THIS PLACE IS A HIDDEN GEM AND I'D DEFINITELY MAKE THE 5 HOUR DRIVE TO SKI IT AGAIN !",gma

8534,2011-02-22,New York,Mt. Peter,3,"This is a good family destination if you do not mind a few drawback.  trails a very much suited for young and beginner skiers.  No big crowds even on a holiday weekend. Most if not all visitors are families with young children.
 maintenance of the place leaves much to be desired, however.  trails were not groomed properly after the fresh snow over the weekend.  rental equipment is in horrible condition. 
Overall   a good place if you bring your own gear.",Karver
8535,2011-02-22,Utah,Alta,5,"I'm an intermediate at best.  I was told to stick to greens because they were even tough.  Not at all!! After a couple greens, the blues were easy (I'm still timid around the blacks)   runs were long and open, very few people around me at any time.   place is huge so I had room if I needed it.  No ice, if there was, I never saw it.   lifts were fast, people were friendly.  I'm looking forward to my next Utah trip.  You can have the sunshine and beaches, I'll go skiing at Alta!!",Nick Franchino
8536,2011-02-22,Indiana,Paoli Peaks,4,"My crew just took up snowboarding last year at Paoli and so far it's been great. Paolis' biggest asset is snow in the middle of Indiana. Paoli reminds me of Dollar General. It's no frills snowboarding and skiing. y have nice snow, the lift lines are short and the employees are friendly.  longest i've ever waited on a lift line is 3 4 minutes...even on college night (it gets PACKED with IU students). You get the idea that they only spend money on the slopes, for me i'm ok with that. But others may want more of a ""lodge"" experience.

Paoli REALLY needs some lodge improvements.  bathrooms are terrible, small and really smelly. y are also in the basement, no bathrooms on the main floor.  lodge is drafty and cold. Yes it's ""snow sports"" so the environment is cold but it would be nice to go in and warm up.  best you can do at Paoli is get out of the cold, not really get warm.  food is expensive and so so.  bathrooms...cmon' Paoli, build some new bathrooms on the main floor and build a nice/warm changing area. Turn the heat up in the lodge and it will be much more pleasant all around. We warm our car up and have lunch in a nice warm car with food we bring on breaks. I think Paoli leaves alot of money on the table by having a bare bones lodge.

We really like Paoli for getting in lots of runs.  runs themseves are a bit short (its not the Rockies) but you can get a lot of runs in as the lifts go quickly. So the lodge stuff doesn't bother us as much as it might others. We've had a great time learning the sport at Paoli. Its been a great experience.",Nick Franchino
8537,2011-02-22,Indiana,Perfect North Slopes,3,"I cannot believe I haven't skied Perfect North before now. It was awesome. Mind you, we're still talking about the middle of the U.S. It's not the Rockies or the Alps. It's not even the Appalachians. Still, Perfect North is one of the best places I've skied south of Maine. 

 hill is surprisingly big. Pefect North does not publish detailed run information (at least not that I can find on their website). y claim a 400 foot vertical drop and a 1 mile ""longest run."" I'd guess that's about right. Runs are reasonable for this part of the country and compare very favorably with anything you'll find in North Carolina. I know there are much bigger places in WV or PA   but I can't drive to any of those on a regular weekend. 

First of all, Perfect North is very well organized.  people who run this place might want to have a crack at running the Indiana State government. . .  I was told we were there on one of their busier days   apparently a special college weekend. re were lots of buses from various churches and schools, and the parking lot filled up by mid morning. Lines for the lifts got longer as the day wore on. BUT, the slopes were not congested at all and the lift lines moved along steadily.  We got lots of runs in. y have 3 big chair lifts to the top. y also have a separate chair lift for the main terrain park (Audition)   which REALLY helps keep a lot of traffic off the other lifts and off the regular runs. y have another separate chairlift for the beginners' area (Ski Wiz & Broadway) which helps cut down on congestion and keep beginners safely segregated from intermediate and expert traffic. Awesome planning by Perfect North on their lay out and lift planning! I'd say we only waited 5 to 10 minutes for a lift during the peak rush. 

re is someone from the staff at each lift line to prevent cutting and shoving. I only saw one little punk try to ram his way to the front of the line (I think it was an employee, too), but he got shut down. y don't put up with any crap here.  Ski Patrol is all over the place, too. It's a safe, controlled environment. Very nice for families with young kids but not like skiing in a police state, either. 

My son and I set out to ski each of the 23 runs and then go back to the ones we liked best. We didn't quite get all 23 but we got close. We didn't even touch the terrain parks (Audition and Jam Session); however, I will say the terrain parks looked good   plenty of ""toys,"" well maintained, and groomed. Also, my son and I didn't spend any time on the bunny hill   Cat Walk, Call Back, or Rehearsal. My wife spent all day on these and was pretty happy to make 16 runs without falling. Four magic carpet lifts (no tow ropes!) laid out in a quad serve the beginners' lesson and practice area. Ski Wiz and Broadway are the bottom ends of other runs, but they have a dedicated chairlift (the green lift) which is great for beginners to access these lower sections without taking on the bigger runs. Nice open spaces, not very steep, for practicing turns and stops. My daughter (13) enjoyed this area and we felt perfectly comfortable letting her ski there on her own most of the day. 

Perfect North has on going beginners group lessons on weekends FREE with the purchase of a lift ticket. It's set up like circuit training in the military   there are 7 stations with instructors at each and you just work at each station until you are ready to move on to the next one. You'll get an introduction to the very basic essentials here. Don't expect to leave this area ready to enter a race or take on a big hill. In fact, if you don't have any particular aptitude for skiing or at least some natural athletic ability, don't expect to leave this area at all. According to my wife and daughter, a few of the instructors are less patient than others and weren't going out of their way to provide any individual attention. But, it's free. If you run across an instructor you don't like, just move on.  main goal of these lessons is mainly to keep you from getting hurt   not to prepare you for the Olympics. It's more than you get at a lot of place, and beginners have tons of room to practice what they learn. 

 trails at Perfect North are sort of naturally split into two groups with one group of trails served by the red and white chair lifts and the other group of trails served by the orange chair lift. Clyde's Super Slide and Short Cut bridge the two sections. 

On the orange side of the hill you've got a nice long run called  Far Side which is OK but not very challenging. It's the longest run on the slope and perfect for beginners to build confidence. re is a series of jumps at the bottom, but you'd have to really be flying to get any air. This slope also seemed to get softer than the others in the afternoon sun, which made it slow in some sections. 

Runway is a nice run that is only a little shorter than  Far Side but quite a bit faster. Four other runs branch off of Runway: Showtime/Lowershowtime, Encore, Intermission, and Special Effects. We only tried Encore, and we had to wait until the kids' slalom race was over before we could get on it. It's a nice, fast run but it doesn't last long. 

Intermission and Special Effects are hard to tell apart, and we didn't try them. y are pretty steep and they both have trees. Showtime is a glade trail with moguls. Say what you want about skiing in Indiana   this run is no joke. If you don't know what you're doing, you will get hurt. y don't require helmets on it, and I'm not a big fan of wearing a helmet just to look cool, but you'd be foolish to do this run without one. 

To get from the orange chairlift side to the red/white chairlift side, your best bet is to go left off the orange lift and take Clyde's Slide down. Go right at the bottom through  Meadow. You will end up telemarking across the bottom in front of the lodge to reach the white chairlift, but it's not bad. It can get crowded when they're having an event at the big terrain park but it's flat. 

 white chairlift serves mainly Clyde's Slide and Hoyt Connection. Hoyt is not truly what I'd call a ""connection."" It's pretty flat and really only lets you pick up an alternate entry to Clyde's Slide. You'd have to climp up a pretty sharp hill to get from Hoyt to the orange chairlift trails. You'll have to do a little skating to get from the white lift to Backstage, Tuff Enuff, Center Stage/Hollywood, or Deception from the white chairlift.  Or, you can just use the red chairlift. Backstage is a slightly faster but shorter version of  Far Side   nothing spectacular but a good warm up run. Tuff Enuff was a fairly tame glade section leading to Backstage and would be a good intro to skiing amongst trees. Center Stage is similar to Encore   a fast run, a bit longer, with a just a hint of moguly ness. From what I could tell, Hollywood was a glade trail running alongside Center Stage and possibly steeper than Showtime. I didn't try Hollywood. 

n there was Deception, a full blown mogul trail. Mercifully short for those of us who don't ski every weekend or do a lot of squats. After the mogul section (which is generous), there's a nice fast section to the bottom and into  Meadow. My legs were feeling it by the time I got through the moguls. This would have been my favorite trail except that you've got to telemark across that flat spot in front of the lodge to get back to the lift. 

As for all the other stuff that you have to deal with where ever you ski   lift ticket purchases, rentals, parking, etc.   Perfect North really has their act together. re is a lot of parking. We got there early and got a spot very close to the beginners' practice area, an easy walk from the lodge when we needed something from the van. Parking is free. re are about a dozen lift ticket windows, six outside and six inside the east lodge. All six outside windows were manned (or womanned) when we arrived. re was a line, but we were out in 15 minutes or less. (I suspect most people were like us and didn't even know about the windows inside the lodge   so the line was probably even shorter in there.) Our cashier was reasonably friendly and very efficient. I didn't feel rushed but the transaction was quick. 

Just a note on the lift tickets: Perfect North uses a weather resistant card like material that attaches with a plastic strap almost like a cable tie. Much easier to deal with than the old fashioned stickers that have to be folded over a metal clip   especially when you have your hands full of gloves, wallets, credit card receipts, and rental paperwork. 

My wife and daughter rented gear and it was a breeze. Rentals are downstairs from the ticket counters. y provide a counter space and pencils to fill out your information and then a staffer guides you into the largely self service process. It may not be the most personalized approach, but it's definitely faster than most places and it works.  Boots are racked up by size (mens size); you find the row with your size, grab a pair, sit down on the nearest bench, and put on your boots. Toes of the boots are color coded. Skis are stored in kiosks identified by colors. Take your paperwork to the kiosk corresponding to the color on your boot and they hand you a pair of skis. Boom. Move through and pick up a pair of poles (if you use poles) from the bins near the exit doors and you're good to go. If you know your shoe size and know how to latch up a ski boot, you'll be out on the snow in under 15 minutes. Snow boards are in a separate room beyond the ski rentals   another excellent plan which helps keep things moving. 

re are coin operated lockers along the back and side walls of the rental area along with several change machines.  $0.50 gets you a locker large enough for several pairs of shoes and possibly other junk   like parka liners, gloves and hats. Staff is all over the place asking if they can help you. re's also a tech shop at the end of the rental area where they apparently maintain rental gear and provide directions to the change machines. I cannot overemphasize how helpful and friendly the staff is at Perfect North. 

Outside the rental area there are dozens and dozens of ski racks, including a section of coin operated locking racks. (I didn't see anyone actually using the locks so I'm guessing theft isn't a big issue here.) re are some dedicated snow board racks, too. se crowd up by the middle of the day, but we managed to find a spot for our gear any time we needed one. Also easily accessed from the rack area are some rest rooms which were nice and clean. 

 lodge itself was huge and had anything you really need. re's a nice deck on the second level overlooking the slopes. y have two different places to get food (plus a third snack bar at the snow tubing area and grilling on the deck on weekends). re's a ski shop and even more seating in the upper level. But, the lodge has all the ambience of a food court in the mall. re are three residential sized gas log fireplaces built into a three faced stone wall at one end of the main lodge. Other than that, it's just one huge open space filled with tables and chairs with two large open spaces comprising the east and west lodges connected to each end. That's great for youth groups and college kids to stuff their faces, but if I skied here often I'd really want to see a section of the lodge set aside for adults and families to relax by a REAL fire and maybe eat something besides a hamburger, burrito, or box lunch. Having said that, I must point out that Perfect North posts their food prices on their website and they are VERY reasonable. This is probably the most affordable lodge food I've ever seen. 

I understand (and even appreciate) that Perfect North caters to families and isn't trying to be a night life mecca. y do not serve alcohol at the lodge. That's all fine. However, there is no other place in the immediate area for ""apres ski"" relaxation.  slope is located just outside of Lawrenceburg, IN in farm country. re are no cabins for rent on the slope, no hotels or restaurants between the slope and town, and Lawrenceburg itself is a very small city which seemed pretty quiet even on a Saturday night. Apparently there's a casino and some other stuff to see, but the nearest place to do karaoke and have a beer or take your family out for a good pizza is probably in Cincinnati   about 25 miles away. We were way too tired to drive to Cincinatti after skiing all day. So, we headed back to Florence, KY where we grabbed dinner at Skyline Chili and hit our hotel for the night.  I guess we really weren't up for much nightlife anyway. If you're into that, I'd recommend getting a room in downtown Cinci. 

Two last notes. We got a package deal from one of Perfect North's lodging partners as shown on the Perfect North website. That worked out very nicely. We ended up getting a very nice hotel room (that's HOtel   not motel) for a very reasonable price. We got two lift adult lift tickets for slightly more than the regular room rate and bought the kids' tickets at the slope. When you consider the very nice breakfast that came with our room, it was an exceptionally good deal. I highly recommend checking into Perfect North's package deals if you don't live within driving distance of the slope. 

Finally, you will want to plan your departure from the slope carefully   otherwise you will sit in traffic trying to get back to the Interstate.  road to town is just a little 2 lane country road and it backs up a mile or two when tubing sessions let out. Bringing a GPS allowed us to bypass most of the traffic. 

Overall, this was the best ski experience I've had in a long while. I highly recommend Perfect North to anyone who is stuck in the middle of the country and cannot afford to fly to one of the ""big name"" slopes.  ",Nick Franchino

8545,2011-02-23,Utah,Brighton,4,"Brighton is a very nice , wide open skiing.  Most areas have plenty of room to get around the snowboarders that like to ""stop & plop"" in the middle of a slope.  All lifts were open and easy to get to.  You don't need to be advanced to have a blast here!!",Nick Franchino
8546,2011-02-23,Utah,Solitude Mountain,4,"I hadn't been to Solitude in a few years. This past weekend, we made a point of making it here. I was under the assumption that Soli isn't that great of place if there hasn't been fresh snow. I was proven wrong. Also, now that I've advanced a bit as a skier, I'm finding out just how fun & challenging the terrain at Solitude can be.

Since the last bit of snow for the Wasatch was a week ago, I was skeptical about the conditions at Solitude: usually the front side is icy and wind blown. But we remained optimistic and got tickets to ride anyway (free tip: military members get $45 lift tickets for either full day or half day riding. What a sweet deal!). We usually make our way back to Honeycomb Canyon, but both the Sunrise and Summit chair  the main gateway to Honeycomb  was out of comimssion due to a power outage. We talked to a friendly lifty who told us to get on the Powderhorn II chair and get into Honeycomb through a gate there. We obliged him, but holy crap...what a slow piece of junk that Powerhorn lift is! Might as well bring a magazine if you ride it...it's slow.

We took the gate into Honeycomb and traversed out to skier's left into some milder terrain in Honeycomb. We were treated to some great, steep glades with plenty of snow and coverage. We got in plenty of soft turns, then were dumped onto the exit trail. After a few seconds of riding the exit trail out of Honeycomb, we ran across another gate that took us back into even more terrain, with some chutes filled in with plenty of snow. We lapped this the entire day, getting our fill of awesome, soft, snowy turns until the gates finally went up.

To warm down for the day, we decided to take a few groomer runs. One thing I've learned from Soli: their groomers are steep! Of course, the challenge is welcomed to a Midwest skier, but holy wow...probably the steepest groomer I've been on. We took some high speed groomers the rest of the day, until we had to pick our way back to the parking lot.

Solitude would be an amazing  on a powder day. It's pretty dang good for non powder days, too  mostly because of Honeycomb  but I would imagine the steep terrain on the frontside as well would be amazing covered up with some fresh snow. Soli solidified itself as #4 in my list of favorite Utah s that day, and I'll surely be returning.",Nick Franchino
8551,2011-02-24,Colorado,Vail,4,"Hi! I just got back from Colorodo. I am an avid 30 year old East coast skier, I actually like Killington and Belleayre for their trees and bluebird days, I like Tremblant for its village and views, I like elk mountain in PA for its day fun.
I travel to tahoe every year, Squaw Valley and Kirkwood have been my standards for perfection, the best and most beautiful powder and scenery, great challenges, and good times. 
I thought I had it all figured out. 
Presidents day weekend 2011 went to summit County with a friend. Figured it would be busy but it's Colorodo and I wanted to check it out. Hit Breckenridge. Very good fun, some good pow, a crazy summit and great trees. Obviously crowded like hell but the trees were amazing. Was told to not go to Vail (Michelle O, first lady, was there plus all of humanity) but instead go to Beaver Creek. Did that on Sunday. Big place, pretty views, too many moguls everywhere, trees were monstrously amazing but dangerous as hell. (4 ft of wet pow and blind jumps everywhere) but really good. Beaver is not Vail though...not even ""F""ing close.

On MOnday the 21, Presidents day, the busiest day of the year, I'm told. I went to Vail. 
With 7 inches of Fresh that morning, 6 the day before, and Blue skies overhead. I had the best skiing day of my life. 
 gondola line was long (45 minutes), but nothing like Breck (45 minutes each lift), and worth every minute. You cannot see Vails scope from I70. But when you get over to the backside..holy crap is it beautiful! Like being on top of the world!  Gore Mt Range is like an alaskan wonderland, the valleys and Bowls so large they could hold cities. and the powder. Dear lord, the lightest fastest powder I have encountered. Crud was actually powder and would evaporate on impact. Trees were beautiful like in Tahoe, Lifts were high speed. Inner Mongolia Bowl had fresh lines everywhere, with almost 20k people there! Everyone was happy and great conversation was found with strangers. SnowBoarders were not bothersome and seemed happy! Lines were minimal (3 minutes) and runs were just long enough (avg.25minutes to get down, I tend to stop and pick off terrain). Food was good, cheaper($12 meal) than Beaver Creek, and Bars were fast, friendly and had a great selection,(Beefeater in stock, Stella on tap.) I don't pretend that it was instant service, this was a holiday, but Gosh people, it was no worse than any other  anywhere. 
Frontside was fun and amazing too! I thought I had done it all, but this place is worth every penny. Parking is free and buses are on time to the minute. Free Buses people! Just relax and be patient! Park at the Safeway by 9am, get the west Vail Bus and go down to the village and grab a intown bus to Lionshead. Takes 30 minutes from the Car to the Gondola.  village is beautiful and has dirt cheap drink specials at 4pm every day! Yes, Rich people with fur coats and spoiled kids are there and some very hot european women! So what? Everyone is happy, and the jetset tend to go to their ritzy places, because they can afford it and is probably amazing. People were so nice in all the bars, I was actually shocked to get a table at 5:00 PM in a crowded bar, owners walking around, locals having fun, cute girls flirting, God nowhere else do people seem to be so alive, it's like New York City!. Beaver Creek was cute and fun but very East Coast skier MidWest style, and Breck was the adolescent college scene, though definately a good scene and great beer.
Found shops in Vail with cheap clothing (Logo Jackets for $20!) I never buy souveniers, but I wanted something this time! 
So why do people post bad reviews? Probably they were in a bad mood, or they are too poor for skiing, or something happened that bothered them, like the old fart that went OOB and complains his pass was pulled. I mean really, dude, not enough terrain in bounds!? You ducked a rope?! Did you even try to go to BSB?. 

I judge this place based on my experiences around the U.S, this place is #1 by far. Sqaw Valley California is #2. Both take you to the limit and make you love life. Yes you will do some traversing at Vail, but they have disc lifts to help, and get in shape if you cant skate on flat terrain. Take your time and laugh it off. Get a guide,or ask a local on the lift to take you to powder, I did. or read up on the place first so you know where to go. It's huge so if you hit the right lifts you can never ski the same place twice and move around everywhere. Move out to the bowls and hit the ridges above or the trees and then back into the bowls. Sundown is incredible, china WOW!, Inner Mongolia  the besty. and explore this place, don't just ski down to the lifts. It is so open and has everything. Great trees, even the groomers were smooth. I will come back every year and it is worth the price. If you can't afford this you shouldnt be skiing. It's not a cheap sport. But this is the place. By the way, the locals I met, all in their 20's, come there everyday, (+PRIMOdank) they showed us some lines in Mongolia, best moments on skiis ever. I screamed like a girl as I hit terminal velocity with pow up to my chest. at 1 in the afternoon! Where can you do that? It looked like Ski magazine cover. and they said the conditions were ""ok"", said I should be there when there is 2 ft! Rent Powder Skiis for this experience, don't have anything less than 86 mm underfoot. Better than anything else in Colorodo, or California, or Vermont. Im out of words...wow wow wow. oh yeah..wear sunblock, at 12000ft and sunny you will burn instantly. I came back with a permanent joker smile and look like a retard. Vail is perfection.",govey80
8552,2011-02-24,New Hampshire,Black Mountain,4,"Liftees angriliy insisting on snowboarders wearing leashes. Conveniently they are sold   not rented   in the shop, for $6.

Explaination? ""It's the law in NH!"" / ""It's a state requirement!"" ... ok, you're the law enforcement on this? I've been boarding for years, all over NH and NOT ONCE have been asked if I was wearing a leash. Know why? y do NOTHING because SNOWBOARDS DON'T FALL OFF and EVERY  in NH knows it's an obsolete law   except Black.

Look, I'm not some snot nosed teen punk snowboarder, either. I'm a mid 30s professional who snowboards   with friends (skiers and boarders alike), weekly, throughout new england. 

Adding insult to injury is the handmade sign posted on each lift declaring this   but the professional permanent sign attached actually says that SKIIERS are ""required to wear retention straps"" also. Care to guess if I saw any skiiers (including the ones I was there with) asked to buy a $6 leash they didn't need either?

Discrimination against snowboarders is pretty much a relic of times past, but just like their aging lifts, their aging snowmaking abilities, their aging lodge, and their aging relevance, their attitude is a relic too. 

For a  so conveniently located near more convenient, nicer s, you'd think Black would make every effort to make every snow enthusiast feel welcome   one or two plankers alike. I'll take my money (and my friends, and their money) elsewhere.

Great views and a great price.  After being to Bear creek and other s closer to the city I can tell you the half hour extra is so worth it to avoid a significant amount of the crowd.  This mountain seems perfect for those beginners starting to hit intermediate as the intermediate terrain is vast and varied to provide new and different challenges.

My favorite perk of this  would definitely be the available terrain the mountain offers.  Whether you feel like hitting East or West, you can find terrain for all skill levels at both s.   terrain park is always a good time, and now it looks like their East  is offering a brand new top to bottom terrain park.  Whether I feel like skiing or snowboarding, there is always available terrain to accomodate my shredding needs.  It's awesome that the park crew is always updating and perfecting their park.  Every week there seems to be something new.   staff at Mountain High has always been really helpful and friendly.  I've read a lot of complaints about the parking, but I've personally never had a problem.   Bullwheel Bar and Grill is always a good time with a great atmosphere.  y throw some pretty cool events throughtout the season as well.  It just seems that there is always something fun to do at this mountain.  This last season, the snow was great.  I bought the 299 season pass, and I will definitely be using my pass ALL THE TIME this season.  Love Mountain High!

8576,2011-02-25,Connecticut,Mohawk Mountain,5,"Mohawk is a fun, good sized, ski area wich is close.  y have an excellent lift system with 2 new triples in the last 2 years.  y have an area for all abilities each with their own lift.

8580,2011-02-25,New York,Belleayre,5,"I think Belleayre has done about all they can to make a good experience for everyone on the hill they have to work with. I'm sure anyone would feel comfortable learning on the seperate beginner hill. Intermediates will have a great time cruising around the main face. Skilled skiers with short attention spans should probably choose a different hill.  top 200 300 vertical feet of the hill are pretty well pitched but, below that, its all pretty flat. That is a consistent condition right across the entire face of the hill. So, just when you feel good about getting some turns together, you hit the flat and are done for the run. It almost feels like the whole place is a runout.  facilities are about what you would expect at a state run area. That is to say, nothing fancy, but, functional for an uncrowded weekday. I think I could see things getting a bit hairy on a crowded weekend. re are lots of folks who should put Belleayre near the top of the Catskills on their lists. Families, intermediates, budget conscious. I just won't be one of them because of the hill itself. ",ryanscottmac

8586,2011-02-25,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,4,"A Basin is definitely a place best suited for the advanced skier/rider. You're not going to get all the bells and whistles of the major s (and their associated crowds) or an apres ski scene. What you will get is some excellent downhill terrain. On to the details...

Parking is right at the base of the mountain, no need for shuttles or a long walk, which is great. We went on a Monday and it was EMPTY.

 main lift from the base is high speed, which is great until you get to the top and realize you're only halfway up the mountain and have access to maybe 5 different runs. All the other chairlifts are slow. Once you've made it to the top, you're faced with decision of heading back down the front of the mountain, or dropping down the back into Montezuma Bowl. This is an easy decision.  half dozen or so blue runs at the top of the front side of the mountain are really just one wide open snowfield since it's above the treeline. y're great when you're looking for a cruiser at the end of the day, but otherwise very boring.

Montezuma is not. Other than a little bit of steepness at the top, the blues are pretty true to their rating in Montezuma, so no need for the intermediate to shy away. A word of warning for snowboarders: keep your speed up on the end of Larkspur. re's a large uphill part that you can see coming well in advance, but it's easy to keep your speed up for that one.  tricky part is after that when you turn through the woods and can't see that uphill stretch coming. I was a little disappointed in the brevity of the glades, but the powder on the walls made up for it. You can traverse far enough on the walls without hiking to hit the good stuff, and you only open yourself up to more powder if you're willing to put in the effort to hike.  wall on skier's right has great steeps; the left is more gentle and has some nice (but short) parts through the trees.

Black Mountain Lodge is your lunch destination. Quality food that's still expensive (but not as much as the mega s) and... reasonably priced beer! Which comes in handy if you need to get your nerves up for the runs off the Pallavicini lift.

This was hands down my favorite part of A Basin. I'm an advanced, but not expert snowboarder, but I was able to handle the Pali lift. If you're fearful like I was, try Main Street or the Spine first, since they would be more appropriately labeled as double blacks than extreme. If you can handle those runs, then head to skier's far left to challenge yourself in the glades or to skier's right to find the bumps. I spent the whole afternoon on Pali until my legs finally cried mercy. It was amazing.

and one last little thing I loved about A Basin...  the views. If it's clear, you can see Keystone and Breck from the top. Even if it's not, the immediately surrounding mountains are just so dramatic and beautiful. All the Colorado s have great views, but this one just stuck out to me for some reason.",Tremblay
8587,2011-02-25,Colorado,Vail,5,"Vail is notorious for being both massive and decadent.  Both descriptions are accurate, but not in a positive way.  Vail is expansive and seems to go on forever, but each peak is just more intermediate runs.  re is variety in terms of glades, open bowls, and some hikable terrain, but the difficulty never goes beyond intermediate.   feel of the town is pretentious and fake.  It's like Disneyland in the mountains.  It appears to be all for the visitors who are more about looking good than skiing.   locals that I met were like locals in any other ski town and did not reflect what the town has become.  I know that I sound pretty doom and gloom about the place, but as a mountain, it is pretty good.  If there wasn't the hype surrounding the name of Vail, the impression of the place would have been better.",Tremblay
8588,2011-02-25,Colorado,Beaver Creek,2,"I've been skiing  Beav for the last two years on an Epic Pass...It's not the biggest, it doesn't have the most snow, it doesn't have any bowls, but for the intermediate advanced rider who can stand an extra 40 minutes on I 70 West, it's always worth the trip.   grooming is phenomenal, and there are enough steep, open blues and blacks to please the speed demon.  re's really no ski patrol either, so charge!  

 best thing about  Beav, however, is that it seems to have a more mature group of riders than Vail, Keystone, and especially Breck...the prices seem to keep the maniacal boarders away, and the lack of a bar scene probably helps too.  I recommend staying in Summit County, head up to  Beav in the morn, park in the Elk lot (it's free), bring your own lunch, although a monstrous slice of pizza can be had for $4, and they lowered the draft beer prices this year.  and at the end of the day, head back to Summit County for the Apres scene, or a few night runs at Keystone.

 only drawback is when it's snowing, not only do you have to go through the Eisenhower Tunnel, or Hoosier Pass, but you have to deal with Vail Pass as well...fortunately, we have good snow removal crews out here, but there are way too many inexperienced drivers to make the crossing safe.  I guess you can take the CME also, and let them worry about it.

Overall, my favorite mountain in CO...and I've been to almost all of them...definitely worth the trip.",Tremblay

Much much better than any small , and certainly competes with Breck and Tahoe. y have everything you can ski/board there; big bowls, long runs (beginning up to expert), etc. One bad part about it though, is that if you are at the bottom of the mountain, it is downright impossible to get over to another side of the mountain or even a different mountain in the . Even if you ski down and are 100 feet away from the lift, you still have to take off your skis and hike. Everything is sloped the wrong way if you need to move anywhere but down. However, the place is very family friendly, I didn't find it to be too crowded at any time of the year, and it has a great village at the bottom. Overall, great !",Tremblay

Nubs should install a poma in the backside tree skiing so it can just be lapped all day long.   front side offers some really nice steeps for Michigan.  When I can't ski out west, I head to Nubs!

Also I paid almost five dollars for a bottle of gatorade and eight something for a slice of frozen pizza.  (criminal)  

 downhill terrain is amazing however the flat parts on some of the runs that call for ski poles absolutely suck for snowboarders (myself included).

 view was one of the most beautiful sights that I have ever seen.   mountains and the lake are literally picture perfect.  This place is a glorious reminder that God is an artist.

However Camelback is my favorite due to the scenery, steep slopes and well groomed slopes. If you ski it early like 9am 11am its like skiing on a carpet. This primarily pertains to the steeper slopes such as Marjie Delight,Rocket,ASP and the Hump.se change from fairly easy to most difficult after 11:00am 12:00pm,due to the snow being skiied off and exposing the ice and hardpack.If you are not a strong skier stay away from these after 11:00am or you could get hurt.

Don't expect to find beginner terrain or groomed runs.  top gets windy, icy, and rocky which makes it difficult for intermediate riders/skiers to get to the fun parts of the runs.

However, usually you have to either walk to the Ski area or catch a shuttle from the parking lot, which can take a while. This is made up for by the speedy RFID tickets and the great terrain. If you come on a bluebird day, you might get a great view of Mt. Rainier.",Charles Hallett
8655,2011-03-01,Colorado,Keystone,4,"I spent 3 days out at Keystone in late January and had a really good time. I've also been there for night skiing once each of the past 2 years. From my experience, the complaints about lack of snow are justified; they just don't get as much as other s. If you want to find powder at Keystone, you need to take the cat from the Outback (well worth the $5) or dip into the trees.

What you will get on the mountain:

Blue groomers. and plenty of them.  ride down the front face of Dercum Mountain seems to last forever, which is great since you don't need multiple lifts to get to the top. Great if you're a beginnerish intermediate. Mozart and Prospector are also long (fairly crowded) groomers good for the lower skill levels. When I was learning to snowboard a few years ago, I thought the greens were a little steep in parts, maybe not the best for true beginners.

Glades. EVERYWHERE. y really run the gamut from open to tight and shallow to steep. To me, this was hands down the best part about Keystone.  Grizz was my absolute favorite until it spat me out on a completely flat and very narrow catwalk.  Windows were also fantastic. Don't let the trailmap fool you, the run to the Windows is downhill until about Gun Barrel. Any of the runs in the Black Forest (north side of the Outback) are looong, fun glades. Glades on the south side of the Outback are also great, just make sure you keep your speed up for the Willows runout.

Moguls. But pretty much only on North Peak and the Outback. Powder Cap and Ambush were fantastic, nice and soft.  moguls on Geronimo and Cat Walker were larger and more hardpack.

What you won't get on the mountain:

Powder. Unless you're in the trees. Most trails are groomed (or moguled)

Short lift lines on the weekends, especially at the Outback.

As for the  itself, everyone was really friendly. We stayed at the Lakeside Village, but rather than wait for the shuttle, we just drove to the free parking lot. It's too spread out though, in general.   bars are nothing special. If you're down with the dive scene, go to the Goat for cheap beer. Keystone wasn't my first choice, but I had a good time.

8656,2011-03-02,Vermont,Killington,5,"So me and 2 of my buddies went to Killington this past weekend, stayed at a dump motel in Rutland for next to nothing but it was a 10min drive from K1 lodge so I cant complain.   conditions were as good as they could have been considering it rained on friday and got cold saturday so that means tons of ice.  

Saturday wasnt bad, a decent amount of people on the lift lines but other than the K1 gondola the lines moved quite quickly.  n again it was so windy n icy at Killingotn Peak it wasnt worth the gondola line at all.

Sunday the mountain was PAAAACKED, I felt like I was skiing at Mountain Creek (aka Vernon Valley, NJ).   lines did move well (other than the gondola) but the ice was awful.  Usually if you stay to the edge of the trails or in the trees you'll stay away from the ice, but nope.   glades were nice looking but straight ice everywhere, and the same went for 85% of the trails, even when I was cruising the edge of the trails I was hitting ice.

 multiple terrain parks were all EXCELLENT, jumps and rails for all levels...... and the stash is something you have to experience 1 hand, its the most unique terrain park Ive ever seen, they even built a huge jump in the glades off of 'the stash.

Other than the ice and people EVERYWHERE it was fun.  I wanna try it again but not on a huge holiday weekend where everyone and their mother will be skiing",skigenome57
8657,2011-03-02,New Hampshire,Gunstock,4,"Went on a Sunday with 12 year old daughter.   layout is confusing and there is a lot of walking to do to get from the main lodge to the chairs. Took a few runs and noticed that the Panaroma and Pistol lifts were not running. Lots of people and also ski racing going on. By 9:30am, lift lines were up to 45 minutes long. Pistol lift finally opend at 11am, but still had a large portion (summit) of mountain unobtainable. Tried to get hot chocolate around 10:30 and snack bar was not open. Would have had to go to main lodge and walk back, so we forged on. By 12:30pm, found out that the summit might not be opened, due to ice still on Panorama lift. Went to welcome center and explained we were finished due to long lines and summit not being available. Gunstock has 1 hour 15 min. guarantee after purchase of tickets, but they were very accomodating and supplied my daughter and I passes for another day.  Overall, mountain is okay, but getting from one side to another is rough. Also, snack bar not being opened 2 hours after the lifts start was strange. One other note: People of all ages wearing Gunstock jackets were very rude and had no problem cutting in lines. Customer service was very good.",WilleA
8664,2011-03-04,Vermont,Sugarbush,5,"Just returned from a 2 day visit to the 'Bush (March 3 2, 2011).  Back to back bluebird days with great conditions.  Both of the main peaks are excellent and have their own flavor.  My advice make sure your legs are in shape, because you are going to want to ride both peaks hard, and you will need at least 2 days to get a sampling of both peaks.

 HIGH points:

 Great expert terrain.   tops of Lincoln Peak and Mt Ellen actually have some great tree skiing.  re are some awesome chutes next to Paradise that still had 2 feet of fresh powder in them.  Last real snow was 4 days before we arrived.  This is a testament to the vast acreage of the place.

 Loved the long groomer trails.  This place is loaded with great intermediate/advanced groomed runs.   Blues of off Gadd Peak (Super Bravo lift) were wide open and great for deep carved turns.  Jester from the top offers great views of all Vermont, the Whites and 'Daks.  

 Some great tree runs off the middle of the hill as well.  Steins Woods dump you onto Birdland, a nice mogul run.  Other great runs:  Domino, Sleeper, and Ripcord.  Didn't get to the Castlerock peak.   double lift didn't turn the day we were there, but it looked awesome...next time I guess.

 Mt Ellen  Rim Run was a great run.  If you don't like bumps, many of the trails here are 1/2 groomed, 1/2 ungroomed.  This made my Fiance happy.  Also loved the whole middle of the Mountain, Elbow, Bravo, Cruiser and Which Way.  Too beat to tackle Upper F.I.S. after a full day in the woods on Lincoln, but Lower F.I.S. is a great LONG bump run.  Just make sure to get into the woods before the long run out at the bottom.

 Both days the Mountain was empty.  Direct on to the lift with no line.  Blue skys and warm temps in the afternoon.  


My only regret  Not enough time/energy to do it all...thats why there are next times I guess.


Sugarbush, along with Jay Peak are the two best in VT.  Jay has the POW, but Sugarbush easily has more diverse terrain and more vertical.  It a long way down, and thats a very good thing!",cody hamlin
8665,2011-03-04,Vermont,Sugarbush,5,"WOW Great ski area good food great terrain. One problem is though is that there is too many moguls almost every black has moguls and some blues. It can get very windy too then they close down Slide Brook Basin and other lifts. Now for the pros. This place reminded me of the rockies It is comparable to Solitude, Deer Valley, and even Alta!  Good mogul runs off the castlerock chair(but thats all there is off that chair is moguls. One run I'd reccomend is Organgrinder off the Heaven's Gate lift sometimes it doesn't have moguls so its a nice steep long black.
     Beginners don't have many options there are two beginner areas though so if you go one day it shouldn't be an issue. Intermediates should go to the Summit lift for Rim run wow thats a great run or sleeper off the gatehouse lift Super Bravo also has a vast variety of blues. Advanced skiers will love it here but you'll have to put up with moguls.  Lower F.I.S is a great run but it may require walking at the end. re are great glade runs here to all over the mountain. Experts will like it here too.  Castlerock lift has almost all black/doubleblack runs off of it like Rumble and Liftline are too very challenging doubles and there are two good double diamonds off the summit lift. re is a ton of lodging here there is a hotels slopeside there is the Sugar lodge, White Horse inn, Golden Lion inn Pitcher inn,  there are some lodges by Mad River Glen too.
    One more thing don't trust mapquest unless you want to go on some back road that is hardly ever plowed you should take that road if it is clear and sunny but anything other than that I would highly reccomend going through Montepelier. re are also some big name hotels in Montepelier too but I'm not sure.",cody hamlin

Only issue is that i did have my snowboard stolen when i went in to eat and the staff at crotched was very unhelpful. Many of them telling me how it was my own fault (agreed i could have locked up my board) but in over 10 years of visiting different mountains i have not once had an issue. y first told me there were cameras but when i asked if we could review them they said they weren't getting cameras until next year (on the rack where my board was stolen).

8673,2011-03-05,New Hampshire,Cannon Mountain,5,"Learned to ski in So. NH, and then graduated north at the age of twelve.  Skied all the old standbys before finding Cannon(Loon, Waterville, Gunstock, Killington, Mt. Snow, Sunapee, et al) but this mountain just thrilled the daylights outta me.  Even before improvements in grooming and snowmaking, I was mesmerized.   Front Five were intimidating and made my parents think twice, but once on slope, they too were convinced.  re's just no bigger mountain experience in state.   tram allows for incredible vertical counts in one day, and the terrain is so quirky and interesting that even on the worst day, you crave more.  Phenomenal continuous pitch over some really unfriendly fall lines.  You have to be on your toes.  If Middle Hardscrabble is open(none too often), you have to ski it.  That's the rule.  No matter how punishing it is.  Upper Ravine and Upper Cannon, cut for telemarking   such twists and curves, so much variety in one descent   it's exhilarating.   reverse is Cannonball(Profile): a disastrous cut on the center of the mountain that is plagued by wind and too wide for the exposure.  Even worse, the quad which was built on the exposed side of the slope to save money.  Lift and trail   awful.  However, now, with the addition of Tuckerbrook and Mittersill, Cannon would have to be considered in the top 5 in New England.  and, this low annual snow count that gets listed..what?  Always snowing here when raining elsewhere.  Not buying it those low totals.  So, give it a shot, but don't come seeking the traditional .  and, for all the marketing otherwise   it's a tough mountain.  Come to Cannon but be ready to work.  You will be rewarded for it.",Danny Zhang

8689,2011-03-06,New York,Peekn Peak,5,"Peek'n Peak is a nice place.  But being called nice is both good and bad.  It means that the place doesn't have any really bad attributes to speak of, but it also doesn't particularly stand out as exceptional in any way.

It is obvious that Peek'n Peak is geared to families, from the charming ""Robin Hood"" names for the slopes, to the large but not too challenging terrain parks, and the off slope amenities.  and if you don't like sharing the slopes with lots of slow moving youngsters, you may not like it here.  I tolerate it with a shrug   after all, if I had kids, this is the place I would be bringing them, too.  

Snow conditions are always good, courtesy of Lake Erie and good grooming.   hills are not very hard, and I often forget where I am at in the , simply because the hills, irregardless of their difficulty rating, seem to blur into each other.  re is lots of easy terrain for beginners, but more advanced skiers will find the hills lacking.   place has never felt over crowded when I have visited it.

Off slope, Peek'n Peak has the amenities of a larger desitination , but not the same hectic atmosphere.  I detest the amusement park atmosphere that big s have.  For this, I much appreciate Peek'n Peak's cozier feel.

Peek'n Peak  is a worthwhile destination, especially for families.  But is it a truly great experience?  No, but it will always deliver the goods when it comes to having a good day on the slopes.  ",shaun

8697,2011-03-08,Pennsylvania,Liberty,3,"Ski Liberty is a member of the Liberty/Whitetail/Roundtop consortium.  at only 650 feet, it is extremely small, with very short runs.  Liberty's location, however, is it's greatest asset.  Under two hours from DC and Baltimore, it is close enough to hit after work, ski until the lifts close and still be in bed at a reasonable hour.  It is extremely family friendly and an excellent mountain for beginners to gain confidence on.  If you keep your expectations small, there are even a few areas that offer some mild challenge for the intermediate to advanced skier or rider.  Liberty has 100% snowmaking coverage, which has been performing admirably this year.  With little natural snow, the man made coverage, grooming and conditions have been exceptional.

Liberty essentially boils down to three main areas, the front side, back side and terrain park.   front side is almost all beginner terrain and tends to get crowded through the middle of the day.  re is an expansive bunny slope sectioned off by itself, providing a massive area for first timers to spread out in.  A couple of non threatening green slopes served by the beginner lift provide a good area to gain confidence on.  This area is even protected by a speed fence to keeping the more advanced participants from coming off the black slopes at high speed.   long ""Dipsy Doodle"" trial gives beginners an opportunity to ski a bit longer run off the peak and provides an easy access chute to the back side.  re are a couple of steeper black trails feeding down into the front side that are your standard racing type trails, wide with a decent pitch, they practically beg to be bombed, so much so that ""Blue Streak"" usually has a speed fence at the bottom forcing you to slow down before entering the beginners area.  ""White Lightening"" is a bit longer with a left turn to a drop on it.  Stay to the inside (left) of the turn and you will find a nice steep section that almost always has good snow cover on it.  Toward the bottom, you can find an ummarked access chute to the terrain park.   main peak lift is a quad that will tend to get crowded during the main part of the day.

 terrain park is small in size, but packs a good amount of features into it.  re are basically five lanes with three to six features on each.  Features range from small jibs and jumps to medium large jumps.  re really isn't anything offering huge air and no halfpipe (although, they have a tiny rudimentary pipe toward the left of the park that doesn't really qualify).  Toward the bottom, you can sometimes find a little beginner mogul area.  A J bar lift services about half of the terrain area and the main lift has a mid station serving the other half.

 back side of Liberty is usually the place to go.  Featuring intermediate and expert terrain, the two quad lifts are almost always less crowded than the front side, even during the peak days.  Coming off the main lift, the easiest accesses to the backside are via ""Upper Heavenly"" or the ""Dipsy Doodle"" chute near the bend.  ""Upper Heavenly"" is right in front of the lift with a slightly steeper drop in to the left.  Taking a lot of traffic, this trail can tend to get bumpy and icy as it gets later in the day.  To get to the expert terrain from the main lift requires an uphill traverse, but given the short length of the runs and relatively light crowds on the back, it is usually easier to head down to the bottom and ride up to an easier access to the experts.   upper part of the back side features three ""double black"" trails off the peak   ""double black"" being a very relative term   which are mildly challenging, but extremely short.  ""Upper Ultra"" is the longest of the three and is usually groomed making it a high speed bomber.  ""Upper Eastwind"" and ""Upper Strata"" are very short, but are usually allowed to go to moguls.  y have a decent pitch to them and would be nice bump runs if they were longer.  ""Sidewinder"" and ""Upper Heavenly"" provide intermediate access around the outside to the lower section.   lower section of the back side offers five trails, four of which are standard intermediates with moderate rolling drops on them.  ""Lower Eastwind"" is the most notable, as it is usually allowed to go to moguls and offers a longer bump run that is good to learn and practice mogul skiing on.

Liberty's lodge is fairly standard.  It has a food court and pizza place upstairs and a coffee bar/bakery on the first floor for quick fare.  Everything is pretty expensive, so picnic lunches are not a bad idea.  On nicer days, they offer an outdoor grill on the patio.  re is a good sized locker area with four changing rooms, that is a nice feature.  Lockers are small/medium/large and are accessed via a computer terminal and entered using a programable code.  y are more expensive than coin op lockers, but offer convenient, unlimited access throughout the day.  Liberty recently upgraded much of it's rental gear, so rentals are currently in pretty good shape, although they have been know to run out of equipment on the busiest days.  A free ski/board check is provided and is very conveniently located.  McKee's Tavern by the Lodge entrance offers table service with pub fare and available adult beverages.  A non descript hotel and snow tubing park round out the base offerings, but the nearby Sleep Inn in Emmittsburg offers much nice accomodations at a lower price.

All totalled, Liberty's tag line ""so close to home"" pretty much  says it all.  It is an exceptionally easy to reach mountain for residents of DC, Baltimore, Frederick and Harrisburg.  What it has to offer isn't particularly challenging, but it is varied enough that it will keep your interest if all you want is to get out on the snow with minimal travel and hassle.  y really aren't trying to be much more than that.",Dave O
8698,2011-03-08,New Mexico,Red River,4,"This is a nice town if you dont want to do much.  Spend 2 hours and you have covered the town.  Not much happening here.  If you want to sit at the house this might be your place.  Lift tickets a little high considering the small amount of runs.  Not very hard terrain.  Skiing and area limited.  Taos a long drive(1 hour) to ski.  We like to ski all day however we became very bored after skiing the same run 3 times before lunch.

8701,2011-03-09,New Hampshire,Cannon Mountain,5,"This is it, probably the best New Hampshire has to offer.  I stayed for two days over the normal February Vacation, and it was pretty crowded, considering Cannon's reputation.  re is a separate beginners area called the Tuckerbrook Area clogged with beginners and little kids in the ski school, which is not necessarily a problem.  Out of all lifts, the Tuckerbrook quad has by far the longest lift lines.  I used the quad two or three times to satisfy my terrain park fix, and liftlines were sometimes over 20 minutes long!  Lines of the same volume elsewhere on the mountain moved along in 10 minutes or less.  That being said, the main mountain is unbelievable.   Peabody Express Quad is perfect for accessing expert terrain, especially the Front Five.  This is the only fast lift on the mountain however.  Liftlines elsewhere are usually non existent, but all other lifts besides the tram are slow as heck, which means freezing fingers and toes while riding up the Cannonball Quad (said to be express, but moves as slow as a fixed grip).  It was a powder day the day before I went, so the condition were still perfect, and the groomers were fast enough, but not icy.   wind was a constant, and on my second day the temperature at the summit was  6 with a windchill of  34.  Steep groomers abound at this mountain of 2100 vertical feet, and carving them up after a powder day was a lot of fun.  Tree runs are a little rare here, but are great as well.   only other terrain park besides the two in the Tuckerbrook area is long and has large and well kept features, with basically its on chair to go with it.   one disappointment was Mittersill.  I found it inconceivable that the day after Cannon received more than a foot of snow, Mittersill was still closed.  It was still closed the next day, for reasons I will never know.   base lodge was fairly cramped, with little space, and many vacationers pouring in by 11:00.  Overall, a great trip with the best terrain I had seen so far in the short time I have skied in my life (only my 10 and 11 day ever)  ",David Moores
8702,2011-03-09,Massachusetts,Jiminy Peak,5,"I just went to Jiminy on a beautiful day with just the right amount of snow.  I consider myself an intermediate skiier and mainly skiied the diamonds today with little difficulty. Jericho ( double black) is also very doable for intermediate high intermediate skiiers so if you're looking for a huge challenge I wouldn't go here but there's a wide array of trails and they have 3 types of blue trails (blue squares with green circles in them, blues and blues with black diamonds in them) and in my opinion they are ranked very accurately.   staff was extremely friendly and the main lift moved very fast which gave us plenty of runs.  It's slightly smaller than Bellayre or Hunter but still has enough trails to keep you interested.",jessoe123
8703,2011-03-09,Massachusetts,Bousquet,3,"Went there on a whim today (few days after huge snowstorm hit Berkshires).  I usually go to Jiminy Peak which is a great place, but for a college kid it can get expensive.  I decided to take a nice drive from the Springfield area to go get a few runs for exercise.  For 20 bucks, or even for 40 bucks, you really cant go wrong here.  Granted, a 20+ inch snowstorm will make any place look good, the conditions were spectacular.  re wasn't a speck of ice to be found.  Freshly groomed, and packed powder, so it was pretty fast going.  re were no lines to the lift, and the views are great.  You can see Jiminy Peak's wind turbine, the town of Pittsfield, and you can even see Greylock quite clearly in the distance.  Being a pilot, I thought it was also a nifty surprise to see Pittsfield airport RIGHT NEXT to the mountain, which is something most wont care about, but I thought that was a great aesthetic surprise for me personally.  re are a few downsides to the mountain however, but in reality most of them are gripes that you will find at any smaller sized New England Ski ""Area"".   lifts are slow (a common thing in NE).  y're are no hi speed quads here; they don't need them.   trails, specifically from the left lift, are fairly short in comparison to the time spent on the lift.  Although this is the case, in a 2 1/2 hour period I got 10 15 runs in consecutively.   variety is also an issue.  re aren't a lot of beginner trails, and none that stem from the top of the mountain.  However there are quite a few intermediate trails (my area of choice) at the bottom and summit of the mountain, and there are quite a few diamonds (the mountain gets pretty steep up top).  DON'T let the diamonds be an issue to you.  If you ski blue trails at any average ski  in MA, VT, or NH, the diamonds are PERFECTLY SKI ABLE to intermediates.  Some steep areas but nothing unmanageable.  Its also got a nice terrain park and an area for kids to ski as well (theres a lot of kids everywhere on the mountain so high marks for family friendliness)  If you are mid to high intermediate, then pretty much the whole mountain is fair game for you.  re's plenty of parking, theres a nice lodge, and both places are mere steps away from the lifts, so its a simple place to park and ski.  If you want to make a day trip to the Berkshires CHEAP and want to graduate to a more ""bigger mountain feel"" in comparison to Ski Butternut or Blandford, the Bousquet is for you.  Take that money you saved for a nice lunch or something.  Joe's Diner in Lee is along the way and really good.  Oh by the way, Sunday lift tickets are like, 25 bucks and weekday night skiing is 10 bucks!",jessoe123

Having grown up in colorado and skiing in places such as beaver creek and vail i had high expectations for this place.  I understand that this is not the rockies.  In the morning the snow is very icy and as the day goes on it turns into a sand like structure.  It feels like youre skiing in quicksand.  I would not recommend this place unless you are desperate.

8730,2011-03-14,Maryland,Wisp,3,"We have been skiing here for 2 years.  It is a 2 hour drive,  but worth it.   Western MD has very unique weather patterns, usually producing a lot of snow and excellent conditions.   Wisp makes more out of 600 Vertical than any  in the country.   In all but one of our visits conditioins were perfect,  and we usually  go at night.   Despite the low vertical,   there are surprisingly long trails.  Of course the Diamonds are relatively short,  but still fun.  I live within 20 minutes of 2 other s (both higher verticals) ,  and would rather drive an extra 100 miles to ski at wisp.   location is also desirable , as it is center to a lake .   WHile we have never stayed long enough to experience anything outside of wisp,  there certainly appears to be a lot of choices for all seasons.

8737,2011-03-14,Michigan,Bittersweet,3,"Overall we had a pretty good time at the .  snow is good, the  is pretty small so there were no lines at the lifts even on President's day weekend. Unfortunately, I think lift #1 is not designed properly. re's a wooden closet to the left of the loading area, so if you turn your skis to the left while sitting down, you run a chance of catching the ski  or boot on this closet. I ended up almost falling off the lift and hurting my ankle, and later noticed that the wood on the corner of the closet closest to the lift is severely damaged, so I wasn't the first or last one to have my skis caught on it.  rest of the lifts don't have this problem. 
It was great that the  had an option to purchase beginner tickets with a $5 discount. Unless you are planning on going down any of the black diamond hills, the beginner ticket is all you need. ",SkiGirlie
8739,2011-03-15,Massachusetts,Jiminy Peak,5,"It is a really good mountain with something for everybody.  terrain parks, however, have nothing for intermediate tricksters. Also, the trails could be smoother. However, everything else is AMAZING :D !!",CTskinerd
8740,2011-03-15,New York,Catamount Ski Ride Area,3,"Considering how close by it is (about two hours from NYC), I was expecting terrible snow, boring trails and massive crowds, but i was very pleasantly surprised.   trails have some interesting aspects to them which separate them from the average run (try the runs turnpike and upper turnpike, these were my favorite on the whole mountain).  We went for a day trip on a saturday in peak season and the size of the crowds surprised me.   lines for the lifts seem long at first but move very quickly, and although certain parts of the mountain are somewhat crowded, certain parts off are very empty with now crowding at all.   only problem with the mountain itself is its size.  Once you get going on a run and your really enjoying it, you find yourself back at the base of the mountain getting back in the lift lines.  But that is expected for a place so close to home, and a compromise I'm willing to make for such enjoyable skiing.  I didn't get such a good look at the terrain park (because we didn't want to waste time getting park passes), but it appeared as though it was mainly jumps with only a few rails and other features thrown in there.  It was a very kid friendly place, good for families with small children.   lodge is alright, but its very small so when lunch time comes around it gets crowded extremely quickly and its near impossible to find a seat, the food is pretty good though.  All in all, if you want to go skiing but you cant make it up to Vermont, I would definitely recommend Catamount.  Its the only place I've ever skied in Massachusetts, so I'm not sure how it stacks up to Jiminy Peak or Butternut, but it certainly beats CT skiing!      ",CTskinerd

8742,2011-03-15,Vermont,Sugarbush,4,"Just returned from a 2 day visit to the 'Bush (March 3 2, 2011).  Back to back bluebird days with great conditions.  Both of the main peaks are excellent and have their own flavor.  My advice make sure your legs are in shape, because you are going to want to ride both peaks hard, and you will need at least 2 days to get a sampling of both peaks.

 HIGH points:

 Great expert terrain.   tops of Lincoln Peak and Mt Ellen actually have some great tree skiing.  re are some awesome chutes next to Paradise that still had 2 feet of fresh powder in them.  Last real snow was 4 days before we arrived.  This is a testament to the vast acreage of the place.

 Loved the long groomer trails.  This place is loaded with great intermediate/advanced groomed runs.   Blues of off Gadd Peak (Super Bravo lift) were wide open and great for deep carved turns.  Jester from the top offers great views of all Vermont, the Whites and 'Daks.  

 Some great tree runs off the middle of the hill as well.  Steins Woods dump you onto Birdland, a nice mogul run.  Other great runs:  Domino, Sleeper, and Ripcord.  Didn't get to the Castlerock peak.   double lift didn't turn the day we were there, but it looked awesome...next time I guess.

 Mt Ellen  Rim Run was a great run.  If you don't like bumps, many of the trails here are 1/2 groomed, 1/2 ungroomed.  This made my Fiance happy.  Also loved the whole middle of the Mountain, Elbow, Bravo, Cruiser and Which Way.  Too beat to tackle Upper F.I.S. after a full day in the woods on Lincoln, but Lower F.I.S. is a great LONG bump run.  Just make sure to get into the woods before the long run out at the bottom.

 Both days the Mountain was empty.  Direct on to the lift with no line.  Blue skys and warm temps in the afternoon.  


My only regret  Not enough time/energy to do it all...thats why there are next times I guess.

8746,2011-03-15,Connecticut,Mohawk Mountain,4,"My kids and I took up skiing this month, and I have to say that because of our positive experience, we are now hooked! Our first lesson occurred during President's Day weekend, which I wouldn't suggest learning how to ski during one of the busiest ski weekends of the season! Still, even with the mobs of people, I was really impressed with how quickly we were able to get our lift tickets and rental equipment.  staff were multi tasking like crazy, but still maintained a pleasant attitude and were very helpful. Many kids were signed up for the children's learn to ski programs, but the instructors kept everything very organized. I felt really at ease leaving my 6 year old in their hands for 2 hours. My 4 year old took the parent tot program with my husband (who is an intermediate skier).  instructor had her skier along with her daddy in no time!  As for myself, there were 8 people in my group including me.  day was extremely windy, so it was really difficult for us newbies. Nevertheless, our instructor made the experience fun, even humorous as we were all blown down the bunny slope by the endless gusts of wind! All in all, I had a blast and so did my kids. 
A few days later, I decided to go back at night time and get another group lesson. Great idea! It was very quiet and not at all crowded. re was only one other person in my group and we received a lot of one on one attention.  instructor even stayed with us to give us more instruction and tips a half hour after the lesson was supposed to end! That's another thing I'm really impressed with.  people who work there are extremely knowledgeable about skiing and it's obvious they all have a passion for the sport. 
 next day the entire family went yet again. My son took a snowboarding lesson while my husband, daughter and myself hung out at the beginner slopes. Thanks to the instructors, my daughter and I were skiing like champs! My husband decided that we were ready to try some of the green trails, so we got onto the chair lift and headed up. We went on Deer Run first, and I was in for quite a shocker! Although the trail is considered easy, for a newbie like me I was shocked to see how winding and steep it was! re is definitely no in between trail between the beginner slope and green trail. Still, I kept in mind what I learned and ski downed to bottom without falling. My little girl skied by daddy's side like a champ! After that, we tried Victor's Way and Pine. Again, for a newbie like me it was quite a thrill ride, but my daughter had no fear.  My husband went by himself up the more advanced trails and really enjoyed himself, although he was surprised by how easy parts of the advanced trails were. 
 kids were properly tired at the end of the day and my son had a blast at his snowboarding lesson. Just one piece of advice; you might want to bring your own food and snacks.  food and drink is outrageously expensive! Overall a memorable family experience, and we can't wait to get back out there again. :)",CTskinerd
8747,2011-03-15,Connecticut,Ski Sundown,4,"I returned to Sundown for the first time since I was in elementary school and was pleasantly surprised.  I'll give the owner credit, he's just about maxed out what he can get from the mountain.  Sundown has always been a good place for families because most of the mountain caters to beginners and you can't get lost.  But they've added some features for intermediate skiers who want to be able to competently ski larger mountains.  Specifically, I like the mogul runs they set up on the side of Exhibition and on Tempter.  Exhibition is fairly flat, the top half of Tempter is short but with more slope and a bail out lane, plus it has the option to skip the bottom half, which is legitimately difficult.  A skier can gradually work their way through these three runs and become much better.
 terrain park has a couple of features that get a lot of action, which keeps a lot of the snowboarders away from the beginning skiers, but it also means that there are a lot of kids who haven't yet learned (and don't seem to be getting taught) proper mountain etiquette.
All that being said, Sundown is small and doesn't offer anything steep (Gunbarrel is a glorified blue).  re's nothing that can be done about that, it is what it is.   only terrain feature that could be added would be some intermediate glades.  It's the best place you can ski in CT, but that doesn't say a whole lot.",CTskinerd
8748,2011-03-15,Vermont,Saskadena Six,4,Suicide six is a good skiing mountain for local families in the area who like having a backyard mountain they can call their own. Anybody thinking of driving more than 30 mins to get there should think about going somewhere else.  trails are short and the lifts are cumbersome to get to.  price is also ridiculous for what you get.

8766,2011-03-18,Maryland,Wisp,5,"As Maryland's only ski mountain, Wisp does a decent job of representing it's state's interests.  It is located in the extreme western part of the state in the Deep Creek Lake region of Garrett County, south of Seven Springs (PA).   location is remote.  Far from any sizable cities, Wisp is a destination unto itself and the  provides pretty much all there is to do when there.  re isn't much in the way of a hopping club scene, but ice skating, snow tubing and the mountain coaster provide a range of nightime activites for the family apart from skiing.

 vertical rise of the mountain is about what you'd expect for this region, that is to say limited.  You won't find any particularly long runs, but the terrain spans  three sides of the peak, which serves to distribute the crowds considerably.   lifts didn't get very crowded when we were there, despite it being a holiday weekend, but that very well could have been due to the less than ideal weather conditons.  Still the distributed nature of the slopes and having  three lifts rising from the base lodge should help to mitigate the majority of logjams in all but the busiest weekends.  

Despite the limited rise, the mountain does have a nice selection of terrain with a good amount of advanced slopes to provide a bit of a challenge for more accomplished skiers and riders.  You won't find any truly advanced stuff here, but there is enough to keep you engaged for a while.   mountain arragement is a bit of a jumble, but good signage provides enough direction that most people will not get lost or find themselves trapped on difficult terrain.  re are several long beginners trails to the right off the peak, which makes for something a bit different than the usual open slope format close to the base.  It should be noted that while Wisp Trail and Possum are very easy trails, well within the ability range of novice skiers and riders, they derive their limited slope by wrapping around the side of the mountain, leaving a fairly steep drop off the left side which can be intimidating to some of the more nervous beginners.  re is also a mid lift off the right serving a selection of other beginner slopes.  Down beyond this lift is a nice intermediate area with three trails.  It is accessed by the very flat Big Dipper trail that will require a bit of a traverse to reach the lift.  This lift services the long Ace's Run and Whip Saw and the short, but steep, Over  Edge.  se are among the more difficult of the intermediate areas.  A traverse off the top, leads back to the beginners mid lift which will return you to the peak.   remaining intermediate terrain wraps around the face from right to left feeding down into Boulder and passing through a tunnel under the mountain coaster, which seems to be a hit with kids.  re were no intermediate mogul runs when we were there.   expert terrain is in two main areas coming straight down the face into the base area and off to the far left with a dedicated lift servicing it.   expert terrain has a moderately steep pitch to it with several areas often being allowed to go to bumps.   slopes coming down the face are adequately steep, but not very long.   more extensive area is the one to the left.  Again, no one is going to mistake this for Vail, but for the region, it presents a fair challenge for the advanced intermediate.   terrain parks are located near the base and are extremely limited.  If you are a park rat, you'd be much better off at Seven Springs to the north.

 lodge is standard fare.  re is an open, cafeteria style seating area for the food court, with a small bar area (Whispers) to one side.  Tucked in behind the food court is DC's retaurant, providing surprisingly upscale dining if you are so inclined.   Pump House Cafe is also an option located at the peak lodge.  Prices were predictably high, as mountain services often are.   rental shop is a pretty slick operation, which seemed to keep people moving reasonably well.   hotel was unremarkable, but the service and location are definitely the reasons to opt for staying at Wisp Lodge. 

Of particular note, was the ease of use of the 's website and the extremely helpful and simple customer service line.  Planning a long weekend trip, I found it very easy to determine all of the lodging and activity options from the website.  Once I had made my decisions, I was able to make all my plans by calling the 's main number.  y were able to book our hotel reservations, set up a snowboarding lesson, make restaurant reservations (on site) and set up all of the activities we wanted to participate in (ice skating, mountain coaster, snowmobiling and snow tubing), all in one easy phone call.  It was definitely one of the better operations I have seen.

 quality of skiing and riding at Wisp should be no surprise, it is standard fare for the mid atlantic region   fair at best.  But as a getaway destination for your family, Wisp does a very nice job of packing a lot of entertainment into a relatively small footprint.  We had a great time and filled up a very busy long weekend without once having to get in our car.",Nick Franchino
8767,2011-03-18,Vermont,Stowe Mountain,4,"Picking a place to ski New Year's Day is always special and for New England, Stowe is one of the best.  First, only the hard core are up for first chair and on a no line day... it doesn't get much better.  Head straight to the fourrunner quad for Goat, Liftline and Starr... awesome runs.  If you need a break from the doubles... there's Hayride.  Luch at Octagon on the summit has super friendly staff and great views and/or take the gondi up to Cliff House.  Apres ski at  Den is where all the locals seem to go... and for real night life there's the village... a classic New England ski town with something for just about everyone.  Great place to spend a day... or a week.

8769,2011-03-18,New York,Whiteface Mountain,5,"Our family arrived at 8am Dec 28 and were on the slopes by 8:30 after getting rentals.  We go a couple of times a year, mostly Thanksgiving or Presidents day, but this time for Christmas Week.  Four or five runs down the lower mountain to get our ski legs back and then off to our first lesson.  We had a group of 8 and only worked on the lower mountain, a bit of a disappointment.  Drills on basic technique.   instructor focused on turning and staying off the edges in between turns.  We had lunch at the base dining area which was crowded, but we found a table.  We spent the afternoon skiing from midstation down the upper and lower valley as well as the Lower Boreen.  We discovered the Silver Glades in between the main and kids campus and my kids had a blast there !.  I did half and exited at my first opportunity, despite their encouragement.

Day two arrival was 7:45 and we were about 20th on line at the Facelift.   grooming was perfect and we were the first down.  I let go a little with no one else around and the wind was ripping at me like I was a kid again.  Not so much as a bump.  This time I completed the glade knowing that I would never live down not doing it.

 second lesson with a different instructor only had my family and 1 other.  We did one run on the bear, then up the facelift.  This guy was very technical about 'inside the boot toe pressure' which showed me how to gain greater control.   Finally a gondola trip to Little Whiteface.  We worked on 'high leg   low leg' drills.  Skiing down from there was quite the adventure.  I'm happy we had an instructor.

Conditions were awesome this time around. It was a little crowded at times, but the previous 2 days had upper mountain closings due to wind, so there was some pent up demand.

Being an avid skier, I expect to ski on some ice and (learn to do so) but I've never encountered really bad conditions here even after rain/ice.   It's PA, not Colorado so let's get used to it.
 one thing I''ve learned is not to carry two vouchers on yourself because it confuses the electronic voucher reader or inactivates one of the vouchers.  y were very understanding and helped me with a new voucher/lift ticket at Guest Services.

people say the lines are bad, i have never waited more than 10 minutes. get over it. maybe on a bad
day when they had to close some lifts because of high winds. but thats the only time you would have to
wait more than 10 minutes, except the bunny hill. But thats because it stops every 2 minutes because
someone falls off.  skiing is what it is, its jersey skiing. always gonna have some ice because of the 
weather and boarders, they really scrape the surface up. but i would rather be here than camelback any day.
you get 3 mountains of skiing with diff. terrain on all. I think the  did an excellence job getting the mountain
open early this year and keeping it groomed pretty good most of the time. and the season pass is very cheap
or the triple play is an awsome deal. Look now, crappy weather and they are 100% open. weather plays a huge
part in the condition of the mountains. just got back from Vermont, 2 days of decent conditions for V, but still a bit icy,
then we got 16"" on last day, that was great. I hope the new lodge is as good as the advertisement. It will be a welcome change from the smelly white bubbles. going skiing this weekend at the creek, spring conditions
will be good. Enjoy.",curbdog

Me and my homies have had crazy fun more times than I will ever care to remember, and have boarded on some killer terrain.  only reason I say these things is to let you know that we are true enthusiasts. So my bros and I went to the U.P. of Michigan to try out some of the slopes up there. A couple of the guys had been up there, it was my first adventure. We got up there and kinda scoped the scene first, looked up facebook pages, that jazz. We ended up deciding we'd do the trifecta and hit one on Friday, Blackjack on Saturday and the third one on Sunday. So we did the Friday thing. That's for a different review. Day 2. Blackjack. Wow, these guys do it right. Nothin way too over the top, but a great Apres ski feel. Live band and super bartenders were entertaining to say the least. Place was packed. Oh, the skiing. Man, the groomers must have painted a picture out there. March skiing had my expectations lower, but this was no Spring skiing.  hill was immaculate! Those groomers know their art! and did I mention 3 terrain parks? Not the silly kind that are like 4 features that haven't been cared for, I mean 3 very well planned terrain parks. Im getting long winded, but you get the point. Families were having a blast too. y had this trampoline thingy with bungee cords hooked to the kids inside the chalet. One more thing, super nice people. All of them. Thanks for reading, try em out and you'll be posting here too. Oh, one more thing, they sell $99 season passes this month. 3 of us bought em just because it didn't make sense not to. Last thing.

8786,2011-03-23,Vermont,Burke Mountain,4,"I like this mountain because it has cheap tickets off of liftopia, the terrain can interest me for awhile, it doesn't over groom everything, it has a good beginner area that keeps my dad interested, and conditions are pretty consistent around the mountain  ""racing"" conditions on Willoughby way, packed powder on Dipper and some pretty sweet stuff in the glades. On most of the glades there's a flat runout to go through and getting from there to the lift can be pretty troublesome.  lift to the summit is long and can be terrible on a cold windy day. Go here midweek and after the race team leaves you're pretty much the only one there. If the snow is there, this can be great for the experts, but if it's not, then there's really not much to do because of limited snowmaking, but with a year like this that's a good thing.

If you go down Kinsman's, DJ's, or any of the banshee area (and sometimes Avalanche, too) you just have to take the tram up, unless it's closed then you'll have to walk all the way to the Zoomer lift, which if in slow snow, can be hard to get to. Believe it or not, there isn't much for the advanced skier that is actually on the map Paulie's Folly, DJ's, and glades (which are generally very spaced out). However, off map and not labeled, there is plenty of hidden glades and trails that can be fun  if you can find them.

We decided to ski all day ,  and then check in.    In my efforts to attain some basic info and get our lift tickets,  the lady at the desk seemed either unable to process much or annoyed from my simple questions.   Questions like... ""Is that the building we will be staying in? ""  Although she was less than friendly,I chalked it up to her just being in a bad mood and thought nothing of it.     HOWEVER..  On our second or third run, my 5 year old wanted to go down ""Hotdog hill""  which has small jumps for the little ones.   re is a small entrance gate with some instructions which I read thoroughly before proceeding.   Upon reaching the first jump there was staff raking the side of it.   As my daughter went over it, he rudely commented that ""we could at least wait until he was done""     After my daughter went over the second jump,  several other staff started gesturing with there arms an uttering comments I could not hear.   My first thought was   I did not see this run roped off, so why the attitude, and if what they were doing required  no traffic,  why did they not rope it off?     After realiazing that I was dropping 2000.00 $  in 2 days here,  I was not too happy with what just transpired.    I let them know in a matter of words I was not happy with what I just saw.   My words were strong,  but warranted.   ONe of these staff members actaully chased me down the hill on a snowmobile to ""have words with me""   in front of my family.    He,  of course was rude and demeaning.   ""Let me give you some advice"" he said.   If you see people working on a hill ,  you need to stay away for your own safety.   I responded by telling him   Let me give you some advice.   1.  run you were working on was not roped off. 2.  I am spending a lot of money to enjoy my weekend,  and  I do not need anyone giving me an attitude.   He then got back on his snowmoblile  fired it up quite excessively   spitting snow all over my 5 year old and driving off.    Yes... I was ANGRY!!  THis pretty much set the tone for the entire day.    I cannot understand how the mountain is not ready to ski upon opening.  THere are 6 hours of daylight to maintain the slopes   Prior to opening, and after close.   As I sit here writing this I have not seen any staff out there other than the groomers.  
It is flat out poor management to not have the mountain ready for skiing at opening.    But wait there is more!

y close down about 1/3 of the  mountain during the week in order to save energy and the earth,  or so I was told.   However they do not discount the lift ticket by 1/3.   This meant that we could not get to the true summit.   So while they have several lifts closed, you wait 15 minutes to get on the only lift that goes NEAR the top.  That was very frustrating!   Standing in line looking at the lift next door not even open!   All to worship at the church of ALgore.  This actually irritated me more than the rude staff.  

I need to point out that most of the staff I encountered after the intial few,  were friendly, and helpful.   Upon Checking in at 5 I explained the intial incident to the different staff at the counter,  and she was very appologetic.  
So,   we will ski 1 more day, and hope for the best.    okemo mountain lodge is fun.   It is a bit outdated,  but being slopeside is well worth it.    In closing,  I cannot understand how anyone working here feels they need to be nasty to those of us paying their wage.   I certainly understand how some people can be difficult and expect too much,  but for 81$ a ticket, and 400$ a night,  the treatment i recieved was out of line.  ",Al Cipparone
8861,2011-05-10,Massachusetts,Ski Butternut,3,"     Butternut is the most overrated  in the northeast.  It was 50 degrees that day but there were bare spots on over half the trails by 12:00 and bare spots on all trails by 2:30!  This is the reason that Butternut is overrated  they were ranked #1 in snowmaking, but on New Year's there were bare spots!  Butternut is also exetremely overrated for family friendlyness.   kindness of the staff was just like other s I've been to.  
     Don't worry, there are a couple of highs:
1. Lot's of quads  but slow
2. Intermediates and beginners will love the mountain  but two expert runs that are easy.

It was like ice pellets. we stopped for drinks and a sandwich and went up again. somehow the afternoon warmt.h and all the 200 skiers there had chopped up the ice rocks and formed a soft hash that was pleasant.our first time here we had nothing to compare to but Vermont and Vail.  7 or 8 runs they have can be glided down in two minutes so they were very short runs, no gondolas.I probably came here pretty spoiled. powder conditons of vermont long runs at vail, gondolas. satisfied my longing to board at the end of a season when the sun is out and there is no snow in NY but I won't be back to this mountain.Was cheap though for lift tickets.",Tj 1
8874,2011-05-19,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"Had alot of fun, good places to go to party at night, great runs but there were alot of people on the weekend, no problem getting up lift but had to dodge other patrons like landmines.",Dave O
8886,2011-07-03,Ohio,Boston Mills and Brandywine,2,I haven't skied for years! in fact i had never been here before. i learned and skied HV in New York. I was skeptic but my son joined ski club for snowboarding. Me and the 13 yr old and 9 yr old (never snowbaorded before) used pass from my 13 yr old. had a great time! ate the food there and it was cold and not very good at all. Next time we will eat ahead of getting there. Too much money for 5 people to eat and not good at all.other than that pretty good.  9 yr old and i had to rent. looked like he had brand new equipment (very nice). i rented skis (nice). Just pricey when you ski ticket and rent. I did like it enough to come back. Went back in February (again free pass from another family member) and i rented skis (fine). Just hard to have to try to take a family of five all at once for lift tickets and rentals. We would definately break the bank!! So all in all.....had a great time just wish we all could more often.Oh yeah...don't know about nightlife because I was there to ski not get juiced!,Drake
8893,2011-07-25,Utah,Solitude Mountain,5,"   We last skied Solitude the year before they relocated the Powderhorn lift to its current location (now accessible from Moonbeam lift, used to be over by Apex lift).  Solitude used to be our first choice  over all others. Not too big, not too small and the beginner skiers and weak blue skiers were segregated from the black diamond skiers by the lift layouts.   We skied it again this March 2011 for three days and in Feb. 2011 for three days.   bowl serviced by Powderhorn was always our favorite.  Unfortunately, the new position of the lift encourages lots of ""not quite ready"" skiers to access the bowl it serves (which is all black diamond terrain).  This causes more ""untimed"" bumps and ""cut accross traverse lines"", etc. as well as ""out of control"" skiers careening down its steeps.  Also, on a powder day, it gets immediately tracked out and has all kinds of ""out of control"" bombers flying down it.  Very disappointing .  This takes a large part of the fun blacks at Solitude away, leaving only Honeycomb Canyon and Evergreen Bowl.  We still enjoy Solitude, but Alta has now moved up to our first choice spot due to losing the enjoyment of the Powderhorn serviced area.  Although, it is nice when they groom the middle of the bowl.  This keeps some of the ""dive bombers"" at bay since they stick to the groomer.
    improvements made to the Moonbeam base area are great!  Nice ""brown bag"" lunch area with lockers and bathrooms, nice cafeteria area with a big fireplace and an outdoor deck for an after ski beer.  Big enough at the base for everything you need but not too big where it takes forever to access it.  Also, the Last Chance Mining camp near the Apex lift has one of the best veggie burgers in Utah.  Great french fries, also.  
  Solitude is still worthwhile to ski just not as much fun for black diamond skiers since the Powderhorn lift has made it too easy for ""not yet skilled"" enough skiers to easily wander into the bowl it serves.  If you ski that bowl on a busier day, be aware of skiers up hill that may not be able to stay out of your way as they come ""careening"" down from above.
   If you enjoy apres ski activity, Solitude is not ideal unless you stop skiing early (at least for day trippers), even then, the beer is not the best.  Everything ""clears out"" and closes early.  However, one does not come to the Cottonwood canyons for apres and nightlife (Park City area is for that).  People come here for the skiing!",Brian Campbell
8894,2011-07-25,Utah,Deer Valley,5,"Took an extended weekend trip to Park City in January with the intention of skiing Deer Valley, Park City Resort and  Canyons. Needless to say I fell in love with Deer Valley and didn't bother with skiing the other s. 

Everything about this  is first class.  availability of Mountain Hosts at the top of every chairlift makes virtually impossible for a skier to be confused about trails and the directions needed to traverse the mountain.  complimentary ski valet/storage is great while you grab lunch or leave the slopes for the night. For a modest fee, you can have your skis waxed at the end of day and have them ready for you in the morning. Additionally, the staff at Deer Valley is extremely helpful/friendly and were always ready to assist to make your day an enjoyable one.

One of my favorite discoveries during the trip was the Rossignol Demo Ski Hut that allowed you up to 2 hours a day testing various skis for free. Definitely had fun trading up for some fatties on a powder day and finding ways to rip untouched parts of the mountain. Recommendation is to make this a priority if you are looking for new skis or want to trade up your rentals on a powder day. Be sure to get there early to beat others with the same idea.

 dining options in the mountain lodges are virtually identical at all locations during lunch.  cafeterias do a great job of offering healthy gourmet options in addition to the typical burger and pizza fare. That being said, expect to spend around $15 20 for a burger, fries, drink and a cookie.",Brian Campbell
8895,2011-07-25,Utah,Park City Mountain,5,"we came on a bad week no new snow, icey, long lines.  amenites were old and broken...  First time out west and it was ok.  Nice long runs  must be amazing after a new snow.  maybe next year",Brian Campbell
8896,2011-07-25,Colorado,Vail,5,"We had spent 2 days at Breckenridge and then headed to Vail on our third day.  Boy did we wish we went to Vail first.   lines were reasonable and the gondola line moved fast.   terrain was amazing with a lot of variety and wide open runs.   snow was not fresh or powdery, more like packed powder but stil good in most spots.   only thing really missing was fresh powder but that's hard to predict with Colorado s sometimes.  Still well worth the trip and all of my friends are wanting a repeat trip to Vail, one day is not enough to explore all the mountain has to offer.

We stayed in nearby Frisco at a timeshare and the drive was not bad at all.   mountain roads were clear and the drive took about 30 minutes.  Parking was expensive and most s do not usually charge for parking but the Colorado s do.   lift tickets are also on the pricier side.",Brian Campbell
8899,2011-08-01,Utah,Solitude Mountain,5,"Solitude is my love. Lesser known, teeming with misfits that just seem to fit, and alive with powder enthusiasts chomping at the bit to eat up untracked lines, and believe you me, there's plenty of little stashes to be had.  hiking access is ideal for those in search of added pleasure and a little extra workout. Slow lifts hardly dampen my mood or love for the seemingly endless lines that one can carve up if they're so inclined to put forth the work. This odd little  is akin to that crazy aunt that's oodles of fun even though she's somewhat quirky and eccentric. ",Brian Campbell
8905,2011-08-15,Colorado,Wolf Creek,2,"Just so you know the perspective of the reviewer here: I love cruising down anything groomed (or untouched powder, none of that choppy stuff), and I will tackle a few blacks on every trip just to mix it up and challenge myself.  For the most part, I don't want to work as hard as is required to ski ungroomed blacks.

Wolf Creek is famous for its incredible snowfall.  Well, I found out that you can actually have too much snow.  My wife and I were here for three days in December 2008.   first day we had perfect weather, but since we ski mostly greens and blues, we pretty much saw all of the mountain that there is to see.  Wolf Creek advertises 1600 feet of vertical, but that is only applicable if you're willing to hike to the expert terrain on the Alberta side of the mountain (there is no beginner terrain there).  For mere mortals, the vertical is more like 600 to 800 feet, which is really pathetic compared to other modern options.  This also means the runs are very short.

During the second and third day that we were there, Wolf Creek received 27 inches of snow.  This is not unusual for this place.   groomers could not keep up with it, and we did not have the equipment to ski it.  We had to ski blacks just to get down the mountain, because the greens and blues were too flat to go anywhere.  We sunk to our knees on every turn, and it was not like floating on fresh powder, it was like fighting through freshly poured cement.  In these conditions, a weakness of Wolf Creek is amplified.   layout is such that there are multiple roads criss crossing the mountain, and to get from one lift to another, you are inevitably going to end up on one of these.  Getting to the Alberta lift and back was pure misery.   way there is a very flat road, and the way out is an even flatter road (there literally is no other way back to the main mountain without hiking to the expert terrain).

Now I have to spend a moment on the worst, and dumbest, part of Wolf Creek.  re is actually some incredible skiing on the Alberta side for experts and intermediates alike, but, as mentioned before, getting to it and back is horrible.  Unfortunately, getting to the Alberta lift is even worse.  For reasons unexplainable to me, Wolf Creek chose to construct this lift on top of a plateau with a 20 foot rise directly in front of it.  Every run on this side of the mountain is funneled to this rise, and you absolutely will not have enough speed to cover it.  You will have to walk up it.  re was plenty of room to construct the lift in the basin directly in front of its current location, but instead, they built the lift at the highest point around!!  I am completely at a loss here, and I would love for someone at the  to explain the logic to me.

So, to sum up: short runs, slow lifts, weak vertical, completely isolated, and not enough variety.  Unless you are an expert, go somewhere else.",Clay King
8906,2011-08-15,Colorado,Winter Park,5,"I just finished up 3 days of spring skiing at Winter Park, and it was simply amazing. To be fair, we had great conditions the first couple days, so maybe my opinion is skewed by that.

Parking: re's ample free parking, especially if you get there early enough. I was always able to get a spot and never had to take the shuttle. However, the parking lot was basically one big mud pit (which presumably is only an issue for spring skiing), and the walk to the base was pretty long, especially since it was uphill at the end of the day.

Lifts: I was there on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and never expereinced a lift line more than maybe 5 people deep. Maybe it was just too late in the season for crowds, but waiting in lift lines was a complete non issue the entire weekend. re's a mix of high and low capacity and speed. Panoramic and Eagle Wind were only open 1 of the 3 daysI was there due to high winds, which seems like a frequent issue.

Terrain: Incredible. Whatever you're looking for, Winter Park has it, and plenty of it. re's plenty of beginner and intermediate trails for those who need them, but the advanced terrain is what makes Winter Park so special. Almost every run on Mary Jane is ungroomed. For some runs, this just means chop, for others it's serious bumps. re are also some great tree runs. If you're looking at the trail map, the big swath of trees immediately left of the Super Gauge lift is epic. Steep, but wide spacing on the trees. re's kind of a trail through the trees, so if you want to keep it loose you can, and if you want to really challenge yourself, you can head into tigther trees off to the side. If Mary Jane were the entire , I would still go there.  Parsenn Bowl is also amazing. If the Panoramic Express is closed, you really can't access much worthwhile terrain from the Sunnyside Lift, but if Panoramic is open, it's fantastic. Huge open snow field at the top, followed by a choice   keep to skiers right and take the path along the boundary (Parry's Peek) or drop into the trees. I recommend the former, because if you drop into the trees immediately, you're left with so so blue runs back to the lift once you get out.  upper part of Parry's Peek is an awsesome trail in it's own right, not just for transport. re are tons of trees and jumps to the sides, allowing you to make the trail as easy or difficult as you want. and the drop back down to the lift is fantastic. Again, plenty of options to customize the run to your desired difficulty level. Unfortunately, I only got one run through Vasquez Cirque and one down Eagle Wind.  top of the cirque was amazing, and I only wish it would have been open the other days.  trees in Eagle Wind start out wide, but end up getting pretty tight. It's not too steep, but the trees there are definitely challenging. It's a looooong runout back from Eagle Wind, which wasn't pleasant. Getting back to the Winter Park base can be annoying with a lot of runouts and confusion, so that was kind of annoying. Well worth it for Mary Jane and Parsenn Bowl though.

Terrain Parks: Conditions got a little slushy on Sunday, so we spent the day in the parks. Rail Yard is great, and offers a lot of variety. Re Railer was a small area, but also had some nice features.  small and medium parks way off to the right on the trails map didn't offer much. Eskimo Express is the best lift for doing laps in the parks, but it's not the greatest setup for laps. Dark Territory requires a speical pass. I'm not sure if you have to pay for it or just prove you're qualified, but there are some HUGE jumps in there.

Lodges/Food: re are lodges all over the place, which is really nice. You're never too far from taking a break if need be. I ate lunch at the Mary Jane base both days.  Club Car had pretty good food, but the cafeteria not so much.  Coffee and Tea Market at the Winter Park base had great European style breakfasts (ie, pastry smothered with nutella and an espresso). Prices are pretty typical of a ski , but not outrageous.

Staff: Unbelievably friendly. Everyone, from the liftees, to the waitresses, to ski patrol. I don't think I got on a single lift without getting a smile from the operators. We took the Eagle Wind chair up just before they were shutting it down due to high winds and my buddy lost his glove. Not only did ski patrol offer to go grab it for him, they had us meet them at the top of Mary Jane, so we could continue to ride in the meantime instead of waiting.

Nightlife: We didn't check out the nightlife at the base, just went into town. We took a shuttle home and a black cab back (just ask the bartender, they should be able to hook you up). It's a pretty chill scene with a lot of locals. I enjoyed it, but if you're out looking to hook up maybe it's not so great.

If you're an avid skier or boarder, get out to Winter Park next season. You won't regret it. I will definitely be back.",Clay King
8907,2011-08-18,Colorado,Loveland,3,"Loveland is big. Very big. It's one of those places where there can be hundreds of people at the lodge but once you're on the mountain, you can have entire runs to yourself.

It's a wide open ski area, especially if you ski the runs over the Eisenhower Tunnel. This was my first trip back to Loveland since 1993, so it was great to see the improvements with the lodge and all of the added terrain.  wind can be a problem, as it was on our trip   they never opened anything on the north side due to upwards of 90 mph winds atop the north summit. Even so, you can still get some great turns in, sticking to lifts 6 and 2. All the runs off these lifts are very wide and skiable for all abilities. Firecut and Drifter are easy cruisers funneling into the mid point reload area. My only complaint about the mid point was the attendants were not inserting a vacant chair at the bottom, so your wait time at the mid point was pretty long. Other great runs include about all of the runs off lift 1, including the moguled Busy Gully.

 snow was deep, however, due to the high winds, it was somewhat crusty. However, as the day wore on, the sun came out. That, coupled with all of the people skiing, really broke up the crusty snow and by 10 a.m., the skiing was fantastic!

Loveland probably doesn't get the love from the hardcore people like Jackson, Vail or even A Basin, but the runs are long, there's plenty of trees and moguls; there's an entire other area catering to beginners and unless you sit in the lodge all day, you'll go home exhausted. and speaking of the lodge, I'll give them credit   they do make a pretty tasty homemade bloody mary!

Didn't vote on the terrain park. It's on the Tempest run, but haven't skied there.",Clay King
8908,2011-08-18,Colorado,Keystone,4,"I ride Keystone nearly every day, even though I work in Breckenridge.   re are several reasons this is my mountain of choice.   First of all, I can park for free and simply walk over to the lift.   No shuttle bus, no gondola from town that stops every 30 seconds, no $25 or $33 parking.   Next, the lifts are almost all high speed, and most provide access to long runs and plentiful powder (if there is snow), as well as providing a lot of vertical in a single run.  Finally the overall vibe of Keystone is just flat out better.    staff is friendly, and you run into far less snootiness than you do at other s.   Easy access, superior terrain (if you know where you're going) and a great vibe makes Keystone an easy choice for me every time.",Clay King
8909,2011-08-18,New Mexico,Angel Fire,4,Fun place to go for a few days.  Little cheaper than some places.  A lot of rental houses in the area to accommodate a group or large family.  Not much of a nightlife but if you go with a group and have a house then you can make your own nightlife.  Smaller base and a little bare at times but if you get a few inches of fresh snow it makes a big difference. ,Clay King
8910,2011-08-19,New Mexico,Ski Santa Fe,2,"After two seasons of riding here, I can say this is my favorite place to ride  in NM. Granted its not up to par with the terrain of taos or the snow fall of red river but for its location it really has a lot to offer.

First of all, you really cannot beat this place on a solid powder day. It's centrally located in NM and sitting at 12K in elevation, there's usually several storm days that bring 8 plus inches.  As far as the terrain I would say intermediate to advanced riders would want to stay on the top mountain lifts (chairs 7, and 3) where there is really a little bit of everything from glades, to bumps, to burns, to a few small cliffs.  Plenty to keep the most advanced rider entertained for at least a couple weekends. But you need to make sure you keep your speed heading back to the bottom and the end of the day as the bottom half of the mountain is essentially cat walk except for Lower Broadway.  terrain park is small but well built. Also boarders, only ride Sunset Trail if your planning on cutting down into the glades, if you don't you will be hiking.

I would avoid this place during holidays and major week ends because there really isn't enough acreage to accommodate large crowds of people unless you stick to the trees all day. Also be wary of this place if they haven't had any snow for a few weeks.  It is after all in NM and it does get warm and the snow does melt.",Clay King

8912,2011-08-20,New Mexico,Sipapu Ski and Summer,3,"Sipapu is perfect the way it is, great facing slope, so the season is super long, even though at times it's a bit stretched. re's only 1000 vertical ft on the main lift, but it's quality terrain most of the way, and the top lift to the trees is incredible on pow days and even 3 or 4 days after, holds snow really well and is pretty much only advanced people, so it never feels crowded. Only at 50min commute from Las Vegas, and always has alot of students there just having fun on the weekend. Quality over Quantity",Clay King

It's small, and experienced riders will get a little bored after two or three days in a row, but as a family friendly place that serves as an awesome complement to the larger local mt.ns, Cooper is fantastic. Powder stays intact at Cooper longer than any place I've ever seen. Our then 4 year old learned to ski there and my wife made her boarding breakthrough there.  terrain is steep enough to make learning useful, long enough to be entertaining, and it includes enough challenging runs to keep experienced riders occupied for a few days.",Clay King
8914,2011-08-21,Colorado,Vail,5,"Vail is a great place to visit at least once in your life.   Back Bowls are really what make this a unique .  As they say, ""re is No Comparison""...........the back bowls of Vail are unique.........because that area is just so big........and they are accessible by many different levels of ability.   fact that the entire Back Bowls and Blue Sky Basin are primarily intermediate/advanced terrain........you can feel safe in the ""sidecountry"" experience that is the backside of Vail.

Because of Vail's reputation, comes the crowds......which can be bad at certain lifts at different times of the day......but if you become familiar with the mountain and all the different types of terrain it offers.....you can avoid the crowds and have a great ski day all day long.......the key is to get to the back first thing in the morning and work your way around the backside for the morning..........have a late lunch.......and then work the frontside to get back home in the afternoon.......

With the great terrain also comes a very good nightlife.........great apres scene......great restaurants.......cool villages....free bus that shuttles you to and from........I like to stay in Lionshead either at Lion Square Lodge or  Antlers.........if I have unliimited funds, I would stay at the Arrabelle.....but that is another tax bracket.  

Vail gets a bad rap because of the crowds and the terrain is not considered as difficult as say Jackson Hole or Snowbird.......but those are trips I take knowing that is the terrain I am getting into........but a great place to take my family skiing and get them into some ""slackcountry"" terrain off the beaten path and have a whole 3 4 days worth of terrain to experience.....I will keep going to Vail......

8917,2011-08-23,New Mexico,Sandia Peak,2,"I've lived in Albuquerque for four years and have enjoyed this small mountain.  I had a season pass to Santa Fe 08 09 and got to board here for free as well and I would come here when they had a good storm, which was surprisingly quite often for this mountain.  n I worked as a lifty last season here and we only had about five solid storms.  

 bad:  main problem with this mountain is that the snow conditions are generally icy unless you go the day of or day after a good storm.   lifts were built in the 50s and 60s so you have to be patient on the way up.  Also don't believe the website when it says the have a terrain park.  y only build it if they're having above average snowfall and even when its up there's only about 4 boxes and a tire kicker.  Management tries to market the place as ""family friendly""  which is good for family obviously but  it generally translates into keeping terrain closed, limited snow making, and very anal ski patrol.

 good:  ski and board instructors and very friendly and accommodating.  This is a great place to lean how to ride, rentals and lessons are very affordable.  When the snow is decent it, there are a few great tree and glade runs, you just have to be a little adventurous to find them.  Also its a blast taking the tram from Albuquerque to the peak especially on a stormy day.  

Bottom line I would recommend this place to people who live near by and want a mellow affordable place to learn how to ride.  But I wouldn't come here for the terrain or plan an out of state ski trip",Clay King

We had a skip the queue lift pass which let us go in our own quick lift line and when we needed it, it was great.  We only discovered we had it on day 3.  Got terribly sunburned even though it snowed about 15"" whilst we were there.  A great mountain divided into terrain suitable for every type of person.  We loved it.",Mark Gerardy
8922,2011-08-30,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"This was my second time skiing in the Rockies. First was a A Basin a few years ago. I'm a mid atlantic skier so Breckenridge was pure heaven to me. Skied for two days April 8 9, 2011. Trails were groomed to perfection. So many high speed lifts. Very short lines, even on Saturday. Such variety to the trails. I especially liked Peak 7 since the trails had such fun dips and peaks. But, 7 got pretty crowded so I continued to move to the higher numbered peaks. Took the T bar as high as I could go that day. I was shocked that they didn't have a real lift there. It was crazy windy and the person in front of me ended up falling off of the bar. No worries as he was able to ride down from there but it still seemed odd that with all of the great lifts elsewhere on the  that they'd have a T bar up here. Near the top (about 12,000 feet) was practically whiteout conditions in the wind.  groomed trail was solid ice but that happens in the Spring when stuff refreezes. I'm glad I did it once but didn't do it again that weekend.  staff was outstanding. If I stood still for more than a short bit, someone came by and asked if I needed any help. Wow. A helpful ""information guy"" was very knowledgeable and told me where all of the groomed black runs were and recommended which ones suited my skiing best. He was right on and I had a blast on Peak 10 for the rest of the day on Saturday. Overall, I was expecting the trails to be more difficult than the ones I was accustomed to in the East. People told me, ""Oh, their blues are like our blacks!"" I didn't find that the case at all at Breck.  blues there were no worse than the mid atlantic blues. y were wider and less steep on average.  blacks weren't that bad either. I didn't venture on to the double blacks as they were primarily ungroomed bump runs. Overall, definitely worth the steep price of the lift tickets. I stayed relatively cheaply at the Great Divide Lodge (Spring Prices) and was very close to the lifts (about 500 feet away).  people there were awesome as well. I will be back to Breck for vacation next season with my 11 year old son.",Mark Gerardy
8923,2011-08-30,Colorado,Winter Park,3,"No matter your skiing ability, there is plenty to keep you entertained at Winter Park.  Perhaps the best feature of the mountain is the way it is laid out, which especially benefits families.  re are very few places where experts and beginners will cross paths, and the terrain is divided into multiple pods where five to ten runs return to the same high speed lift.  For families or anyone who just loves a smooth, groomed run, I highly recommend the terrain off of the Olympia Express and High Lonesome Express lifts.  se areas contain only green and blue runs, so you don't have to fear being run down by a bored expert flying past you.

Of course, everyone knows about Mary Jane, and if you enjoy bumps or long, consistently steep runs, you will likely spend most of your time here.  For me, Mary Jane trail is about as good as any run anywhere.  It's usually half groomed and half bumps, so everyone is happy, and it just goes on and on.

Parsenn Bowl is breathtaking, and for a blue cruiser like me, it's also heaven.  se are the longest runs on the mountain, and the bowl is served by a high speed six pack, so you can make laps with just the right amount of rest on the lift.  y do a good job of leaving some runs natural while grooming others.  I could ski a different line in this bowl all day long without getting bored.  One note of caution though: do not get stuck here on a cold, windy day.   top third or so is completely exposed, and that lift ride is brutal in the wrong conditions.

I heard a ton of good things about Vasquez Cirque, but since I don't go out of my way to ski blacks, I didn't check it out myself.  This is another example of great layout at Winter Park, because that section is hard to get to and only has expert stuff, so different skill levels don't cross.  As for Vasquez Ridge, this area is a hidden gem.  Though you will have to pole at the bottom of these runs, these blues are worth it.  My wife and I got to make the first tracks down Buckaroo one morning after about three inches fresh on top of grooming.  I don't know what heaven will be like, but I hope it's similar to that.  I floated the entire way down, making huge GS turns with a smile on my face.

 last thing I'll say about Winter Park is that the base area lodging is incredibly more affordable than other Colorado s.  y have the expensive slopeside condos if you want, but they also offer three high quality affordable options within walking distance of the base and multiple choices in town (2 or 3 miles away).  We actually stayed at Iron Horse Resort, which has ski in ski out access along a trail connecting the base of Mary Jane Mountain and Winter Park Mountain.   great thing about this location is that it allows you to end your day at the bottom of Mary Jane Trail.  That's a pretty darn good way to finish.",Mark Gerardy
8924,2011-08-30,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,3,"High in altitude, we find a very good quality of snow.  We've been there for one day and found prices very affordable for a mountain this quality.  at the top you have a view over the entire World...  Definitely smaller than other s in the region but a different style.  Another interesting point, as in all s in Colorado, you'll meet there lots of beginners and as chairs are pretty slow you have lot of time to see them crashing...  Great show!

8925,2011-08-30,Colorado,Vail,2,"Vail is a  that lives up to it reputation of glitz and glamour, and for skiers, the best part is Vail's unsurpassed acreage and number of lifts to the ends of the earth and back bowls. Vail can be disappointing however. First, parking is $25.00, and there are not any way around paying the heavy parking fee without subjecting yourself to a major hassle of logistics with your ski equipment in tow. Even after paying $25.00   the walk from this supposed close by parking lot still involves numberous steps and a long, winding walk through the large village that involves walking, and more walking, until you finally arrive at the lifts. It is highly recommended to wear shoes and carry your ski boots at Vail, and rent a locker and be prepared to spend several dollars (not quarters) for the locker too. 

Meeting someone at Vail can be also be another exercise in logistics. With multiple parking areas, all charging $25.00 or more, visitors are not funneled into one or two areas, but several.  lift system that connects the mountain can require up to four lifts or more to get from one side to the other. Getting across the mountain is difficult, much more difficult than jumping between peaks at Breckenridge. 

Like Keystone, the front side of Vail is a mess, cut up little runs that spegetti and meander around, ending in unpredictible places with blacks that turn to green to blue and back to black. Vail is an easy place to get lost, and that is even on the front side. Without a trail map, you do not have a prayer. 

Vails back bowls are its saving grace, with wide China Bowl and many others to be places where intermediate skiers can work on their skills. Yet these bowls get quickly tracked out, turning powder into endless fields of crud to ski though. Going out to the furthest possible reaches of Vail will finally get you some decent skiing at Blue Sky Basin, which is the only reason that I will go back to Vail. This is a truly a great experience where you really feel like you have left the planet and are skiing somewhere in the remote Himilayas. Vail gets one gold star for expanding to include Blue Sky Basin, the equivilent of Keystone's Outback   a nice remote area where you can find powder on a good day and away from the crowds. Otherwise Vail can get crowded, despite the further drive from Denver. ",Mark Gerardy
8926,2011-08-30,Colorado,Vail,2,"Vail is expensive.  Yes, let's get that out of the way.  re's no way around it, but you get what you pay for, and that is certainly true here.  If, like me, you are budget minded on your family ski trips, I can offer a word of advice.  You can book a lift and lodging package at Keystone or Breckenridge and use half of your ski days at Vail or Beaver Creek.   drive from either place to Vail is about 40 minutes and about 50 minutes to Beaver Creek, but it will be worth it, because you'll find much cheaper lodging deals at Keystone and Breck than you will anywhere near Vail.

If you do end up driving to Vail, the town offers free shuttle service, but you'll have to look on their website to find where you can park for free.  If you're going to pay the $20 plus to park in a garage, I suggest you use the one in Lionshead Village instead of Vail Village.  It's a much shorter walk to the lifts.

Now, once you're up on the mountain at Vail, there's nothing else to worry about.   terrain is fantastic, there's plenty for all skill levels, and there are high speed quads everywhere you look.  If you are not enjoying yourself here, then skiing just isn't for you.

 back bowls are a must at Vail.  China Bowl is amazing (and groomed).  Even though the other bowls are all marked as black, there are plenty of manageable spots back there.  y're challenging, but you don't have to be an expert to enjoy them.

Blue Sky Basin, the newest terrain at Vail, is also incredible.  It's secluded and has no crowds, and when they groom it, you won't want to leave.  If you are at least an intermediate skier, you will want to check this area out (and probably spend a good long while there).

 front side of Vail gets the least attention, but fear not, there is a ton of good skiing there as well.  Game Creek Bowl is great, all of the runs off of the Avanti Express are fun, and Bwana, Simba, and Born Free are excellent, long runs to end your day with.",Mark Gerardy
8927,2011-08-30,Colorado,Beaver Creek,5,"People from outside not welcome, parking at 33$, no day lodge, cost of the food, crowded, lots of low level skiers, lifestyle of the rich and famous, bad experience...  Advanced skiers not well served by this type of .",Mark Gerardy
8928,2011-08-30,Colorado,Keystone,4,"First, beware of their parking lot:it is awful.Now to riding, Keystone was a blast. It doesn't take a long time to memorize all the runs it has to offer Most runs take a long time to get down to the bottom so you aren't spending all your time on a chairlift. It is a very popular tourist spot though. When we go during March there are always tons of people on weekdays and even more on the weekend. So if you plan to go there during spring break season avoid holiday riding UNLESS you go to the 3 mountain on the back. I would recommend taking the Outpost Gondola and taking a blue or black down to the Outback Express.  express is a little slow but very scenic and there us usually no one there so if you are searching for some leftover powder that's the place to do it. You don't have to worry about kids, people trying to learn, or crazy boarders. Night skiing is a trip too. That was a lot of fun as long as it isn't too cold. ",Mark Gerardy
8930,2011-09-03,New York,Holiday Valley,5,"Having been a regular @ HV for over 40 years I have grown up with this mt.n. I have skied every inch of it and it is still unequalled by any other area in the East & Midwest! From great skiing and boarding to incredible nightlife with great variety of restaurants, Eville has it all!!
Nothing like skiing and boarding in Devil's Glen and Happy Glade after some fresh snow!  natural rails that are in Happy Glades are very cool!! With the new High Speed quad servicing Devil's Glen glade all is perferct in our world!!
Don't forget to stop at the Depot Bar and restaurant after skiing for some killer Pizza and legendary wings!!!!!! Say hay to Moose (owner) when you're there!!

8931,2011-09-06,Colorado,Copper Mountain,3,"Copper Mountain is conveniently located off exit 195 just down the road from Frisco and Silverthorne. re is plenty parking at the free lot in the front while the shuttle bus takes you on a very short drive directly to the lifts. Copper Mountain is the most easily laid out, intuitive, impossible to get lost mountain ever made. When facing the mountain: Advance skiing is to the left, Intermediate in the middle, Beginners on the right side of the mountain. 

While the back bowls still pale in comparison to Breckenridge, they are still quite respectable, but sometime take some serious poling or even hiking to get to depending upon the lift taken. Resolution bowl, a side bowl, can be a nice, powdery mogul challenge whereas Copper bowl is more prone to get crusty, but are fantastic on a powder day. Despite all statistics, the mountain and its run seem long, perhaps because many of the ski runs go from the very top of the mountain to the very bottom.  Copper Mountain is very convex, adding to the feel that the mountain runs are very long, whereas Arapahoe Basin and crested Butte are much more concave. 

Like Breckenridge's T Bar, Copper Mountain has poma lift Storm King, which would someday be a very nice improvement if made into a full chair lift. Beautiful pictures on the top after taking either Sierra or Rendezvous Lifts. 

Upper Enchanted Forest is exactly this, a very enchanted place of wonder, mystery, intrigue and mystique. A must see for glade skiers. Unless you really like moguls and ski them well, consider Too Much, Far East and Triple Treat with a word of caution.  black diamond ski slopes under Super Bee are much more forgiving with fewer moguls. 

Union Creek can get you quickly trapped into a place with lots of beginning skiers in crowded lift lines, and no way out except to take the High Point lift.  far right side gets VERY flat and is not a place for snowboards who lack ski poles. 

re is a nice restaurant at the base of Super Bee lift and this is a decent place to set up your base camp, whereas Union Creek is much more crowded and a bit of a trap to get out of to the rest of the mountain. Center Village is second place to East village's Super Bee. Beyond the magic carpets, quaint and peacefully pretty Green Acres is a nice transition for Class 2 beginning skiers to hone their stills in an unintimidating environment. 

Overall, Copper Mountain is a cross between no frills Arapahoe Basin and Keystone: while nice and offers some great skiing, Copper Mountain feels dated, the ski lifts feel antiquated by Breckenridge's standards. While the villages are nice, Copper Mountain just has a feel that it needs some renovation   either more terrain expansion, a gondola, a logo makeover, a fresh coat of paint on the ski lift chairs, more shops and businesses or something. Copper Mountain has not expanded their terrain in decades. While a great place to ski, and a wonderful place to learn to ski, Copper Mountain has a shelf life and can get old after 4 6 days of skiing. ",Clay King
8938,2011-09-15,Colorado,Arapahoe Basin,5,"Arapahoe Basin is a non glitzy, regular old place that is still a major player in terms of  visibility and amount of terrain, but more reserved and with considerably few amenities. re is no overnight lodging facilities at Arapahoe Basin. Three large gravel parking lots, no gondolas, no valet or VIP service. However, parking is free.

Arapahoe Basin has several crown jewels: Pallavicini, East Wall and the back bowls of the mountain service by the Zuma lift.  rest of A Basin is relatively bland, nothing too exciting. However the crown jewels are worth checking out and exploring. Arapahoe Basin is known more for its advanced terrain and as a locals laid back hangout. Pallavicini is a steep and a legendary ski run, that it makes the top ten list of must ski runs in North America.  

Upper East Wall rarely opens, leaving Lower East Wall still a cool bowl to ski around boulders and off an occasional small cliff or two, but offers enough flexibility to take easier routes down too. Some of Arapahoe Basin requires hiking, including Upper East Wall. A Basin has one of the highest elevation of any ski area.

Arapahoe Basin (and Loveland) are the first to open in North American for the season and last to close for the ski season. It has been reported that A Basin has been open for skiing as late as the 4 of July for some seasons.

 parking lot at Arapahoe Basin can be very festive, like a football tailgate party with an area known as "" Beach"", where skier/sunbathers tailgate, eat, listen to music and watch people ski down the mountain. Even more festive are the pond skimming days in May, where participants attempt to ski from snow to water across a small pond, with many actually making it all the way across, while some have hilliarious crashes that make for many youtube videos and cheers. This is the party place, especially for locals and hard core skiers.

With the exception of next door neighbor Loveland, Arapahoe Basin is the closest major ski  to the Denver area, as Echo mountain severely pales in comparison and Eldora is closer to Boulder. Black Mountain lodge at mid mountain is a nice stop for lunch or to warm up with a hot drink.

A Basin is the place to get your skiing fix, when all the other s have closed for the season, or if you hear that they opened up Upper East Wall. ",Clay King
8939,2011-09-18,Pennsylvania,Camelback Mountain,4,"Just want to congratulate Camelback on being one of only two ski areas in PA to remain open to the end of March/early April (the other being Big Boulder) and certainly open latest now, since BB has closed.   March 24 was idyllic, with fresh powder and no lines; conditions among best in season.  April 2, (weekend) was crowded as usual but still.... just awesome to ski this late in season.   Since I haven't skied here in maybe 7 yrs, the black diamonds now seemed flatter (goes with experience) and I was surprised that Cliff Hanger (double black) is actually easier (although longer) then the other single blacks diamonds.   Still, the spread of trails allows you to feel like you're on a bigger mountain.   I look forward to getting back next year.  ",Lorenzo A
8940,2011-09-18,Vermont,Killington,5,"Many say ""size isn't everything."" However, that feeling when you ski a huge area, that you can barely scratch the surface in a couple days is, you have to admit, intoxicating, and very rare in the east. Plus, Killington has much more going for it than just size.
But let's talk about size for now, which is enough reason on its own to visit. You have 80 miles of skiing. Each of the seven mountains is about the size of your average size ski area. Hang at Bear mountain for some knee shaking steeps and moguls. Ramshead, Snowdon, Skye peak, and Killington Peak are cruising heaven. re are also some great steep runs off of the peak. On top of all of this, you have Pico, which is bigger than a good chunk of ski areas in the east, included on your Killington ticket, yet uncrowded, though you have to take a quick shuttle to get there. For beginners, there is snowshed, a huge beginners' meadow, ramshead, and the beginner area over at pico. Plus, there is a green off of most of the lifts at Killington, giving beginners a more adventurous experience. With all of this, it is impossible for any ability level not to have fun here, no matter how crowded it is. 
While we're on the subject of crowds, Killington is so big that you can ALWAYS find a lift with no line, even during vacation weeks and weekends. Some tips if you're here during a peak period: as a rule of thumb, the two gondolas will have the largest lines. If you must ski off the gondolas, do it early in the morning for the first hour or two before they become mobbed. at peak times (between 10:30 and 2) ski off the mid mountain lifts.  north ridge triple accesses some great, albeit short, cruisers. Plus, the only time that lift ever sees a line is during the early season, when it is the only operating lift. If you're an experienced skier, the Canyon quad accesses great vertical and terrain but doesn't see lines very often.  south ridge triple (the funky one that turns halfway through) rarely sees a line as well. In general. If you must ride a high speed lift (they generally are the most crowded) but want to avoid crowds, hop on the needle eye's express quad, which rarely has a long line and accesses some diverse terrain. But the absolute best crowd avoidance tip? One word: Pico. Pico rarely ever sees lines, has diverse terrain and good vertical, and it included on your Killington pass: a no brainer if you are here for multiple days and you get tired of crowds. Some more tips: try to have an early or late lunch, so you can ski while others are waiting for their food. If your metabolism can't handle that weird eating schedule, carry some energy bars or try eating mid mountain or at the peak lodge. re is a big lodge at the peak (though they are replacing that with a new one) and there are multiple small places trailside to eat, like Vista Deck. 
Killington takes great care of their trails and snow conditions. y do a great job grooming, and their snowmaking covers more skiable terrain than most ski areas in the east have total, so you can count on good conditions. 
In terms of terrain parks, they have a 22 foot high superpipe (for the dew tour) and many large terrain parks for all abilities. You also have the Stash, which is all natural features and like no other park you've ever experienced.  
and, of course, the night life is great. re are so many options for whatever entertainment/restaurant you like along the access road, but keep in mind that it's pretty spread out (unlike other ski towns like Stowe) so it would be better to have a car. 
All in all, Killington is the most complete ski experience anyone can have on this side of the rockies and though it has it's haters, follow my tips and you will have a great time. ",Lorenzo A
8941,2011-09-18,Pennsylvania,Liberty,2,"Took a snow day yesterday and hit Liberty for what looked to be the best day this week (weather wise). Got there later than I wanted 10:00 but still had a nice day.  place was empty until about lunchtime. Even then, it was just a little less empty. Never had to wait in line for a lift. Snow was soft where it was in the sun (most of the back side) but the blacks on the front were still pretty solid (icy)  especially where they were in the shade. Staff was friendly  but knew that the end was near  this upcoming weekend. Everything was groomed nicely. I started on the back side but ended up staying on the front side  on the two black diamonds since they kept their surface best. I like skiing on ice so those were the best trails for me. A few bare spots showing on a couple of the blue trails on the back side. I think there's a little more snow this year than their was last week of 2009 2010 season. ",Lorenzo A

However the 2 time I went, I was a strong intermediate and some cons started to show up.  prices were high for lift tickets, and I had to wait in line for 15 minutes or more to get on the lift. In the morning, the snow was packed and very nice, but once the afternoon came along most of the slopes were icy and the snow was heavy. 

So overall, I think Whitetail is a great place for newbies because the lessons were fantastic and they have a great amount of beginner slopes. Not recommend for families because of the high prices.

Some of their old double chairlifts are a bit too quick or speedy when getting on them. My friend almost got knocked down because he had very little time to react when this double chairlift scooped him up. So be careful on those old double chairlifts. On the trail map, they say that they would have additional runs further to the right side of the trail map for the future developments, and I wish they would develop those sooner already because it seems to be getting crowded already for this  every time we go.

Mittersill provides some natural skiing, but can be tracked up faster than one might think. Mittersill is a fun place to explore though.

9005,2011-11-27,Colorado,Wolf Creek,4,"Wolf Creek is a smaller but yet robust ski  with charm and pleasant surprises   as well as a saving grace for the best early season skiing when all of the other ski s lack snow coverage. In many cases, Wolf Creek is sometimes the only ski  which has any powder, especially deep powder. Even during Thankgiving weekend, I observed 0 5 minute lift lines. While there are only five full sized lifts, the ski area spreads out across the entire mountain. Like most small to medium size ski s, the quaint mountain house and lunch choices are modest, yet adequate for those on a budget, just be sure to bring cash. Parking is also modest and somewhat hap hazard, so best to arrive early. Along with the more quaint rustic feel, the signage (blue signs with carved green letters) mean that trails are not often well defined in terms of either the clear cut of trees or signage, yet for the most part, you will most likely end up safely at the base regardless of which ski run(s) that you take or end up skiing. Overall length of ski runs is on the small side. Wolf Creek is really two parts   the right side contains the groomed runs, where 90% of the skiers ski. This includes a vast array of short to medium sized bowls at the top above timberline, some which require hiking or moderate poling. While there is adequate beginner terrain, this is more of an advanced and intermediate terrain ski area. re are also many bush sides trees on many of the groomed slopes which serve great for skiing gates. On the left side, serviced solely by the Alberta lift, is a wilderness of the best tree skiing imaginable. This is not skiing tree islands between groomed runs along a narrow carved out dog path, this is genuine backcountry glade skiing. This is like having the freedom of a backcountry experience, but still within the safety of being in bounds. Far on the left side, a person can ski and not see another skier for many miles, abd lose yourself in the nature, silence and beauty of the wilderness, the only downside is that more hiking may be required. Ski run Serendipity opens intermediates up to glade skiing without large intimidating mogals, but instead with trees spaced the perfect distances apart. For the best tree skiing unlike any other  that has supposed glades, Wolf Creek outdoes all. However be wary of the flat spots on Albert side Camino Del Monte Sol and Okey Dokey / A Way trail/traverses.

For those looking for luxury and atmosphere, Wolf Creek is not the place for the pretentious, rather Wolf Creek is about skiing and a step back in time to a typical Colorado ski area in the early 1970s   while limiting to some, charming and more focused on just the innocent spirit of skiing to skiing purists.

Silver Creek was decent, but there are no high speed lifts and it takes forever to get up and no time at all to get down.   beginner trails were packed with people, even on the rainy/windy day, it was like trying to navigate through a Where's Waldo book, and it got worse on weekends.

When the nearby Park City s are starving for snow, Alta still manages to have plenty.  Also, don't buy the belief that Alta is just for advanced and extreme skiers.  y have a great collection of blue runs serviced by high speed lifts, and the Sunnyside lift provides high speed access to long greens at the bottom of the mountain.

 mountain is divided into three main areas, each of which is served by a high speed lift.  Two of those three lifts are gondolas, which is great for people who get cold easily (my wife).  This is also nice on those bad weather days, which happen frequently here I am told.

 other thing that makes Snowbasin stand out is the incredible luxury of its facilities.  It is owned by Sun Valley, so everything is first class.  It actually helps you enjoy your break for lunch instead of feeling uncomfortable and rushed to get back on the mountain.  and, yes, the toilets are gold plated.

For beginners, Snowbasin has a high speed lift serving a very gentle slope that is untrafficked by other skiers.  It is a really good set up, and that really helps make this place family friendly.",Clay King

9055,2011-12-19,California,Mt. Baldy,4,in truth if the snow coverage is poor   which it often is   then baldy is still FAR better than the other local alternatives.  y make snow and groom a blue  run and a black run and you can ski those perfectly happily for southern california.and when there is snow   which happens a few times a year... it's pretty crazy.  black and double black runs are legit and there's some 'off piste' to do among the trees where you kind of have to jump a fence because they don't want the general public in there but it's the real deal. ,SkiForFree
9056,2011-12-19,Massachusetts,Wachusett Mountain,3,"Really not a bad mountain for being in MA. For me I go there often due to it being the closest mountain for me to ride. About an 1 hour and 15 min away. Its a good mountain to take friends that are just learning, a very good mountain to build confidence on and get comftable. Here are some keys to enjoying this mountain. During the week 9am to 3pm its usually pretty dead and your able to have the mountain to yourself without any lift lines. at about 3:30 pm kids start to roll in like a heard.  place pretty much turns into a mall on a friday night, its pretty bad. Weekends after Christmas get really packed and lift lines are pretty long.  night riding is pretty good because they have just about the whole mountain lit up with very good lighting. After about 8pm the place turns into a ghost town and you'll have the whole place to your self till 10pm. Its not a very challenging mountain at all. I have to also say that the staff that works the lift lines are extreamly rude!!!! I'm sure some of this is due to them having to deal with all the kids and teens that take over the whole mountain. Tickets are expensive for such a small mountain. and they don't make as much snow as they should, when things get very icy the really don't try to fresh up the trails at all. To put it in a nut shell if this  wasn't the nearest for me to go I would never really go there!!! On a powder day when its dumping out and everyone is affraid to drive in the snow the place is pretty quiet and very fun. y do groom twice a day which is a positive. ",Three2Ski
9058,2011-12-20,West Virginia,Timberline Mountain,2,"Spent the last weekend of March 2011 at Timberline Four Seasons Resort.  conditions were fantastic. A large percentage of trails were open. Temps all weekend hovered near freezing.  top of the mountain stayed solid all weekend.  bottom got a slight bit soft on Saturday afternoon with the sun coming out. On Sunday, we woke up to two inches of new powder and had a couple of excellent runs down the moutain. Fortunately, they had groomed out the moguls from Off  Wall which left an incredible, steep trail that I hadn't gone on before. I hope they groom it in the future as it really was a great trail. White Lightning was it's classic awesomeness  allowing nice wide GS style turns all the way down. We scheduled this weekend months ago, expecting slushy conditions but really lucked out. I'm sure the  could stay open at least one more weekend but it's tough getting people to come out that far. Great ski/board trails at this . Definitely worth the long drive for a weekend stay.",Dave O
9069,2011-12-22,California,Mountain High,4,"Went here with a free lift ticket to check it out and see if I wanted to get the season pass that was on sale for next season. Was an easy drive from San Diego, but after riding there realized I would rather drive farther for better quality.  lift gates are like a cattle herd with no attendant really watching them or keeping it organized and they oversell tickets, so the zoo of a lift line is long.  runs on the west are short.  east is good when it's open, but nothing to write home about. Realized quick why I paid a little more for gas and went to other s in the area and why I'll pay more for the other 's season pass next season. Too many people sitting in middle of the runs here and can be dangerous.  parking lot is not really monitored and I would not feel good bringing my kid here to see people smoking out in between runs (cool when I was younger, but not now with a family). For the money they do charge, they could do a lot better in the professionalism and quality areas. Plus the other two s in the area can pump out a ton more snow than this place. Will I go back??? maybe if i get another free pass, but I wouldn't waste my money here. ",SkiForFree

9164,2012-01-17,Colorado,Silverton Mountain,4," good:  views are amazing.  guides have a great attitude and will keep you safe. This is an adventurous place and you will be in the company of great skiers. You will get steep 40 deg runs though on most of the mountain they are very brief.

 bad: y claim ""Our base lies at 10,400’ with a peak lift served elevation of 12,300’. re is hiking to 13,487’, which means with a little effort you can get around 3,000’ vertical drop."" 
What they don't tell you is after you get your run down the culoir, across the apron, and down the rest of the fun stuff then about 1000' of your vertical is down a cat track to then catch a bus back to the lift. 
y are actually counting a bus ride as vertical shame on them.

Other than that their website gives you a pretty good idea of what to expect. I would add that you should not have the expectation that the purpose of your guide is to lead you to blissful powder runs.  purposes of your guide are :

1. Keep you and your group safe by picking your lines for you among other basic guiding skills.

2. Tell you where to ski so that you stack lines, and don't track up any more of the terrain than you have to so others can get fresh lines. 

3. Tell you where to ski to help them compress the snow as an avalanche mitigation strategy.

4. Keep a great attitude and ensure a cohesive and positive group dynamic.

I personally felt a little restrained by the guide and felt like I was working for the mountain instead of the mountain working for me. I expected fresh lines due to the limited number of people on the mountain, but even on a heli drop I was sent down a skied off culoir and was scolded for not keeping my line stacked close enough going down the apron. Heaven forbid I take advantage of the one good line of powder on the mountain the whole day. 

I have gotten more fresh powder and vertical in the first 2 hours of the day at major s on weekends then I did at a full day at Silverton.

Do it once for the bragging rights, and hope for a powder day : )",Mark Gerardy

Since then it has gone down hill and we've had to go elsewhere.  first thing they did was spend a bunch of money on a new computer system that left people standing for HOURS on opening day waiting to get their passes, equipment, etc. y've had tremendous snow the last few seasons but have managed to run off all of their good help and loyal customers. It was a virtual ghost town last year. y spent a bunch of money on computers, TVs, and signs, but neglected the slopes. y've logged a bunch of trees out to make room for houses, etc., but in the process have created areas where the snow now blows away. y have limited snow making ability.  2 year they owned it there were bare spots in the runs almost all season despite good snowfall. y routinely run snowmobiles down the middle of certain runs making big ruts for beginners to negotiate.  worst neglect was of their lifts. y hardly opened the back side for the first 2 seasons because of lift problems and the 2 season it was only open for part of 1 day before a chair fell off of it!!! I don't think they even bothered to open the backside last year. y also let trees grow up in the middle of runs for a couple of years. y took over the ski school and got rid of all the good instructors. y took over the food service and now it's too expensive.

9228,2012-02-03,New Mexico,Angel Fire,4,"Our family (2 middle age parents, 2 pre teen kids) dropped by AF for a single day of skiing on our way home(Texas) from three days skiing at Purgatory/Purgatory Mountain.  My wife suffers from a medical condition which keeps her on shorter green runs so we needed to determine if AF was suitable. (BTW, Purg's lower ""learner"" section is almost perfect for her)  
It snowed about a half inch the night before our ski day. I suspect that AF management decided to call this dusting of snow ""powder"" and forego grooming.  crusty/icy conditions turned what could have been a great day into a marginal one. My recent (last 3 years) comparisons for ""grooming"" are: Purg, Red River, and Sipapu. Even lowly Sipapu manages to break up the icy crust and fluff up the packed down snow, but apparently not AF. 
Had the snow conditions been equivalent to Purg, I would've written a glowing review of AF's trails/lifts/etc, and given it high marks for beginner/intermediate trails. 
In other areas, my general impression of AFResort is this: they do not understand that they are in the hospitality business. Hospitality is an attitude, not a condition so it's hard to give exact examples but I just didn't get the feeling from most AF employees that they were glad I was there. Additionally, I will echo most other reviewers and mention the lack of/poor accommodations, lack of food, lack of town in general. Oh yeah, the parking lot is muddy, and they refuse to allow skier drop off anywhere near the base. A skier drop off area near the base would be a small but significant sign that AF ""takes care of it's guests"" 

Looking to close on a positive note, I will repeat my assessment that the ""heading home"" trail is excellent for a smooth, no drama, trip down from the top of a mountain.

9229,2012-02-04,Utah,Brian Head,4," New Year 2010   2011 ski season was our first trip to Brian Head Ski Resort. What a place!

I admit that prior to traveling to Brian Head I did not like the name, the website or the fact that the web camera has been down all season but I did like the fact that the Brian Head Peak is primarily black and blue runs. Yes, we were all newbie’s once but they can be difficult to tolerate sometimes; however, I did find that the newbie’s at Brian Head were not typically difficult to navigate. Perhaps, that is because I did not spend much time on the Navajo Peak. 

I recommend driving past the Navajo Peak lodge and going directly to the Brain Head Peak lodge for your lift tickets. I do not intend to sound as though there is nothing useful at the Navajo Peak because there are runs that are fun there too.   

 panoramic views are spectacular.  ski runs are clearly marked and well groomed. Yes, when I was younger, I enjoyed powder but now that I am more mature, my body does not enjoy the powder as much. Powder equals work plus extra risk and my plan is to ski all season, every season and at 50 years old less powder. 

Our second day at Brian Head the winds were gusting to 50 mph with blizzard conditions; therefore, we were only permitted to ski the baby slopes in deep powder, which was actually refreshing to be forced into skiing deep powder. Yes, I berate powder continually, since I am now at a mature age but I would ski the baby slopes in a blizzard with 50 mph gusts and deep powder as opposed to sitting in the lodge like a crybaby asking for a refund. I have stated it many times… there is not a bad day skiing only bad attitudes.

9248,2012-02-11,Vermont,Killington,3,"I've skied Killington dozens of times and I've tried to like it, year after year.  But I can't find anything I really like about it.  I actually hate it.  Its by far the worst skiing experience in the country.  Why?
 Crowds.  Killington is always crowded.  Weekends, weekdays, early season, late season   the trails are dangerously crowded and the lift lines are painfully long all the time.  
 Price.  It's horribly overpriced.  Lift tickets, food, beer all ridiculously priced.  Its one thing to have high prices and nice amenities but Killington is expensive and the lodges are trash, the food sucks and the lifts are slow.
 Service.  I was taken out by a snowboarder in front of a Killington patroller and he did nothing.  A Killington ambassador almost plowed into someone I was with due to blatant reckless skiing and he skied off without an apology.   bars have terrible service.  I've never had a positive experience with any staff member.
  skiing is awful.   trails are always icey and skied off.  If it does snow, its skied off by 10 AM by every idiot from New York and New Jersey.  Most trails are boring and over crowded.  Any challenging trails are rarely open and if the are, they're icey and treacherous.  
 re's no sidecountry/backcountry.  re's no way to escape the crowds.   East's best s at least offer side country terrain to duck into the avoid people and find fresh snow.  Killington is all inbounds crap.

If you're venturing to VT for a ski trip, do yourself a favor, drive right past Killington and go a little further to Sugarbush, Stowe or  even Jay Peak.  Its snows a lot more there, the crowds are reasonable, the skiing is so much better and you'll actually see how good VT skiing can get.  ",Joseph O'Brien

Like chutes?  I do.  It's bad new to try to repeat on a busy day, but ski or ride the Peruvian Cirque.

If you just want the very best powder, then on powder days held to Alta (unless you're a boarder) and climb and traverse and climb somemore and traverse a little further and you'll find the best Wasatch powder at Alta    that little extra elevation makes a difference.

9291,2012-02-21,Pennsylvania,Roundtop Mountain,3,"Roundtop is a member of the Liberty/Whitetail/Roundtop consortium.  Like Liberty, it is a very small mountain, with only a roughly 600ft vertical that severly limits the length and number of runs.  Despite these limitations, however, Roundtop actually does offer a fairly diverse range of skiing for such a small mountain, including some interesting and challenging trails not found in most small, local s.

 beginner area to the far right is standard open slope fare, serviced by a magic carpet and a dedicated lift.  We never rode this lift, but the lines on it seemed to get fairly long pretty quickly.   beginner area did offer a small beginner mogul area and a few terrain features for novices.  re are no beginner slopes off the peak, leaving few options for those who progress off the bunny slope but are not yet ready to face the crowds on the blues.  First or second timers will probably be better served at Liberty or Whitetail.   intermediate terrain is very limited, consisting of five ""trails"" that really amount to fewer than that.   main lift line trail, ""Minuteman"", is a straight shot open slope under the lift that seemed to get crowded quickly.  ""Lower Lafayette's Leap"" is little more than a crescent spur off of this slope that's most notable reason for existance is access to the halfpipe.  Toward the midpoint, the main trail splits off to form the ""Recruit"" slope, which is a wide slope half covered with moguls that made a nice training ground for skiers looking to improve their form.  ""Susquehana"" is a non discript slope that is basically just an access to the expert lifts.  ""Exhibition"" is the racing trail under the double lift, that was actually kind of a fun little run to hit at high speed.  NASTAR racing is offered at times on this trail, giving casual skiers and riders a chance to run some gates for a small fee.  Where Roundtop really gets interesting though is in the diversity of its advanced terrain.  ""Upper Lafayette's Leap"" has a fairly good pitch to it and was half covered with moguls when we were there, providing essentially two different skis in one, depending on which side you chose.  Feeding along the ridge from the peak to the beginners area is the unusual and interesting ""Barett's Trail"", which is a narrow, winding New England style chute.  Slightly icy with a couple of trees in the middle of it, Barrett's offers a few different options that enable you to ski it several times and find something different each run down.  It's not overly challenging, but it is something different for this area.  Look for the narrow, icy drop to the inside of the tree toward the bottom for a fun little plunge into the final turn.   mainstay of the advanced terrain at Roundtop, though is found to the far left, in ""Gunbarrel"" and ""Ramrod"".  Both are served by a remote, dedicated triple chair that never seemed to have any line at all, despite it being a peak weekend.   lower parts of both trails are wide open, rolling screamers with a couple of nice drops that can generate some good speed.  Occasionally, parts of these trails are allowed to go to moguls, providing an even wider range of options.  ""Upper Ramrod"" is a short, fairly steep drop that is usually groomed.  Wide, with a couple of dips and rolls, the trail skis quite differently depending on the line you choose.  and then there is ""Upper Gunbarrel"".  It is not long, perhaps 100 feet or so, but it is 100 feet of the steepest, most challenging slope you will find at any of the three mountains and probably south of Vermont.  Ungroomed and bumpy, the slope immediately plunges away from the peak at a nerve rattling angle.  Skiers standing on the top moguls puzzling over how to attack the beast are a common sight.  Stay to the left side and you will be hard pressed to find anything steeper for hundreds of miles around.  Sadly, try not to fall, because you will likely slide to the bottom and the excitement will be over before you know it.  It only takes four or five solid jump turns to clear the steepest part before you move into the flatter lower section, which will seem like a tremendous letdown as you look back up at what you just crossed.  But finding even a few seconds of terrain of this calibre within day trip range of DC, Baltimore or Philly is a rare thing.

Right in the center of the mountain is the moderately sized ""Fife and Drum"" terrain park.  It offers the usual range of jibs and jumps, with a few large features in the center that invite the more accomplished skiers and riders to entertain the folks on the dedicated chair lift (that also has access to the beginner area).  re is a good sized halfpipe on the left side serviced by a J bar and cross access from ""Lower Lafayette's Leap"".  Toward the top of ""Minuteman"", you will find the relatively uncrowded ""Bunker Hill"" area that features a couple of jibs, as well as a small and medium sized jump.

 lift arrangement is very good at Roundtop.   base is very wide and distributed, which spreads the crowds out across the mountain and minimizes logjams.   terrain park is accessable from the base area, which frees up a lot of capacity.  Some of the lifts are older, such as the double and triple chairs serving the expert terrain, but with few lines to speak of, it just didn't matter that much.  Snowmaking coverage was quite good, but there were some icy areas, particularly at the high traffic areas off the peak.  Snow quality was not as good as Liberty, but much better than Whitetail.

 lodge is bright, airy, modern and clean.  A standard food court with a large cafeteria style table arrangement is housed on the main floor.  A somewhat darker and stuffier picnic area can be found downstairs.  Upstairs, you will find the ""Fireside Pub and Grill"" offering sit down service, pub fare and adult beverages.   pub is an uncommonly nice facility for a PA ski mountain.  Food was above average for ski lodge pub fare.  Like it's sisters, food prices are quite high.  re is an outdoor concession with a firepit on the patio, that made for a nice place for an afternoon snack and beer.  Like Liberty and Whitetail, there is a complimentary ski and board check, lines for which were longer than Liberty, but much shorter than Whitetail.  re are very few lockers available, so you'll either have to use the box check downstairs or leave your valuables in the car.  Access to the facility was quite good.  re is no hotel on site, but plenty not far from the mountain, as well as a number of interesting B&Bs. 

Like it's sister mountains, Roundtop does not claim to be anything more than a small, local mountain that is close enough for an easy day trip.  It is not going to challenge the expert skier and cannot hold a candle to the bigger mountains found in New England or out west.  It would be absurd to contend such a thing.  However, if you keep your expectations within reason, there is a lot to like about Roundtop.  It won't hold your interest for more than a day or two, but within that time, there are a few unusual things to explore and challenges to be had.

9296,2012-02-21,New Mexico,Angel Fire,4,"Angel Fire is sometimes overshadowed by Taos, but actually serves the less experienced skiier much better than its nearby, better known neighbor.  First off, Angel Fire has the only two high speed detachable lifts in the state of New Mexico.  With the Chile Express lift being over 2 miles long, this makes a huge difference.

 runs at Angel Fire serve the beginner, up to the advanced intermediate very well.  Heading home is a great run for beginners to start on, and allows them to take the main lift all the way to the top.  Intermediates are well served by a variety of blue runs, a couple which are left ungroomed, and have a few black runs to step up to when they are ready.  Hells Bells, Nice Day, and Glory Hole are all great advanced runs that challenge the advanced skiier, and the hike to trails can't be missed when they are open.

 base area is the sore spot for this mountain.  re is no main base lodge, so all the facilities are spread out in their own buildings around the deck, with lots of stairs separating the different facilities. This is not very pleasant when it is snowing, and the  would be well served adding a true day lodge at the base. With the recent improvements to the country club, Angel Fire has shown they can put up great facilities.  It's time to improve the base of the ski area to these standards as well.  

For those staying in the Angel Fire hotel, the rooms are very lodge, and the connection to the base deck is good.

As long as your group doesn't have a lot of expert skiiers, Angel Fire will serve you well.  If the snow on the front side doesn't look good, just stay on the back side, as the back is a great north facing slope.  Also, if you can, avoid the holiday periods.  As long as you visit outside the holidays, there will be very few lift lines and uncrowded slopes!",scott

9299,2012-02-21,Wisconsin,Cascade Mountain,5,"I made a day trip from Chicagoland on a Tuesday, hoping to avoid lift lines, which worked out well since the wait time was almost zero.   mountain top express lift really moved people quickly, so I was able to get a lot of runs in.  However, the Cindy Pop lift was so annoyingly slow, though, that I stayed off that side of the hill, even though that was where some of the best runs were.   terrain was pretty good and the black runs were steep, but I don't feel like I got my money's worth out of the 'stated vertical', since the top of the hill is pretty flat.  I wasn't using rental gear, but the equipment that people were using looked pretty decent.  Also, one skier was renting out new K2 Photons from the ski shop, as part of a deal where you could rent the latest gear, then credit the rental price against the purchase price if you wanted to by it.  It seemed like a good strategy for trying out different skis if you were looking to buy. As a side note, it is often pointed out that Cascade is relatively expensive, however, I got my lift ticket by using a voucher from the WSIA coupon book, so the cost wasn't really an issue.

9331,2012-03-01,Utah,Alta,5,"Sooner or later, everyone comes across an ""Alta is for Skiers"" bumper sticker plastered on the back of someone's 4x4. You even see them in the East, where I live.  re is a reason for this and now I know what it is. It goes beyond the fact that it is a place for skiing and not snowboarding.  Alta ski experience is the essence of skiing.  re is minimal glitz and just a lot of snow, steep terrain, incredible mountain scenery, and many, many skillful skiers.  
     We spent two days there last week and each morning started with the booming of the  avalanche control work that was going on as we waited for the Collins lift to start loading.  We were fortunate to find powder each day, although there was no shortage of others who were also in pursuit of it.   alpine scenery is magnificent, with trees, peaks, cliffs, jagged rock faces, and open bowls of powder.  Having someone who knows their way around would be a definite asset here, as there are many gullies, hollows, and cliff bands scattered throughout the terrain.  Much of the terrain is very open, but much of it sort of sneaks up on you.   cliffs are well marked with ropes and signs, however.  
     Alta does have groomed cruisers, but I can't imagine going there if that is the kind of skiing that you are looking for. re is no shortage of bump runs and plenty of ungroomed terrain on the days that we were there.

9384,2012-03-18,Montana,Whitefish Mountain,5,"re are not words to describe how much I enjoy this place.  First off, it is absolutely massive.  You like groomers? re's tons.  Steeps?  Trees? Tons of that too.  I gave the terrain park 4 stars only because when I was there this year, they were just getting the fishbowl opened and there was just maybe a dozen very small features packed at the bottom of the run where the park is.  I was kind of disappointed because I thought there was enough snow to have done much more, but I know that once they get the thing built, it's pretty good.  Honestly though, as much as I like riding park, there are so many other places to have fun on Big Mountain that it didn't bother me in the least.   weather can be a bit challenging, but like they say, snow comes from clouds, so what are you gonna do?  re are also plenty of nice places to eat or have beers, and overall, I didn't think the food was overly expensive.  Certainly no more expensive that stuff at our local places in Western NY and PA.  I definitely recommend going straight to be back of the mountain.  Great runs and still no lift lines.   Bigfoot T Bar is also a fun place to hang out when it's open.  I stayed with a family member in Kalispell, so I can't really speak to accommodations and/or nightlife, but the town of Whitefish is great and has tons of cool bars and good spots to eat (Buffalo Cafe and Great Northern were great).  Full disclosure   I'm from Northeast Ohio, so if you live in Utah or Colorado or something, maybe you wouldn't love it as much as I did, but I doubt it.  I've also been to Okemo, and while Okemo is great, Whitefish puts it to shame.   vast amount of terrain and complete lack of lift lines make it great for anyone.  If you're an east coaster or Midwesterner looking to head out west, I highly, highly recommend checking out Whitefish.  Oh, and if you want cheap lift tickets and have a Costco membership, the one in Kalispell sells lift for like 50 bucks.

9385,2012-03-18,Montana,Whitefish Mountain,5,"First, I have to say that I can only review a very small area of the mountain.  We're beginners so we didn't go to the summit.  y had really good green runs and it was neat skiing through the vacation condos.  and I know there's plenty of blue and black runs throughout the rest of the .  fog was pretty heavy our 3 days there, but if you ski in the trees it's not so bad.  It lifted a few hours into the morning, but again we weren't as high up in the mountain so it was probably worse at the summit.  But it snowed all 3 days we were there so that was a huge plus. 

We did night skiing there also and that was awesome.  Only 3 chairs were open, but it was our first night skiing experience so we had a blast. y're terrain parks were lit up also.  My husband and kids really enjoyed the ramps and the rails they had there.  

We had a great vacation and I highly recommend it if you are military.  We got 50% off all lift tickets and rentals.  Lessons are also 50% off, but we didn't take any.

We stayed at the Okemo Mountain Lodge, which had a ski in/ski out great location.   rooms were definitely a bit dated, but I go on vacations to ride, not to sit in a luxury suite.   Spring House was a great little after skiing activity, it was just kind of a pain to drive there and then change into swim gear and whatnot (though that would not be an issue for those staying at Jackson Gore).  I really, really liked the terrain parks, and the pipe was in pretty good condition for the weather being what it was.  Overall, loved the place.  Tons of runs, lots of stuff that you can do with your kids and any other intermediate riders you might have in tow.  You pretty much had to go into Ludlow for food after the mountain closed, and there weren't a whole heck of a lot of options, but it was a very minor inconvenience.  Staff was also very friendly and helpful, especially when we got separated from our very adventurous 4 year old for a couple minutes.  I have not been to any other s in Vermont, but I can definitely say that I would almost definitely go back to Okemo next time we head up that way.   only reason I didn't give the terrain 5 stars was because I didn't really see an opportunity for much tree skiing or anything, but I also know that's kind of tough to come by on the East coast.",shaun

We usually stay on the side of the Base   Clock Tower. For those who seek more challenging terrain, there are many more Black Diamond trails on the Jackson Gore side of the mountain.

9455,2012-12-11,Virginia,Massanutten,3,"My husband and I decided this would  be a nice Christmas present for our four children (ages 20, 17, 12 and 10)since we've never been skiing and snow is not something we see much of in Alabama.  My sisters and their families went with us, making it a total of 12 people.  We stayed in the Summit on Peak Drive and had the most beautiful viewI've ever seen. It overlooked the slopes and at night it was awesome.  Three deer stood outside our window while we ate breakfast one morning and we saw many more throughout the week.  I learned to ski without ski school but my sister and brother in law enrolled in a class and recommend it for everyone.  My children picked it up very quickly but my husband and I took many falls and have many bruises.  We took the younger ones to the waterpark one day and they had a blast!   kids loved the rec center as well.  Walmart is only about 10 15 minutes away so we went there and bought groceries for the week.  We ate most meals in our room with the exception of our dinner at the Fairways Restaurant and a Japanese steakhouse in Harrisonburg.  Both were very good.  Skiing was expensive but as I said, it was our first time and I've heard it is expensive everywhere.  I was concerned about doing laundry but it is very conveniently located right downstairs.  Also, it says there is no hairdryer but ours had one.   only negative thing that we encountered was the tour that my husband agreed to.  I was asleep in the car when we arrived and he checked in without me.  y talked him into a tour and gave him two activity cards.  He told them he wasn't sure I would agree to it so they assured him that as long as we didn't use the cards we could cancel.  y took his credit card number in case we used the activity cards and did not show up for our tour.  When we got settled in our room I told him we already had plans to go to D.C. that day so we tried to cancel the tour and take the cards back.  We couldn't get in touch with anyone and did many activities without using the cards. When my husband tried to take the unused cards back they would not credit our visa and said we would be charged $200.00 if we didn't do the tour.  We ended up having to do the tour and are waiting to get credited our money.  We made it very clear that we were very unhappy and didn't appreciate them misleading us. I think it is something worth mentioning to others so they don't make the same mistake!  We had a wonderful trip and would recommend it WITHOUT a tour.",AltSchneemann
9456,2012-12-11,Virginia,Wintergreen,2,"First, I snowboarded every weekend over the Winter during the last 3 years.  I've been to many s and this is by far the worst.  Here are the reasons why...

1.  re are too many blue and black trails that are closed.  I see shrubs and bushes coming out of the ground.  It looks like these trails were never even opened for the season.   ground looks terrible.   I know this season has been tough, but geez...this is a ski , make the snow!

2.   ski lift operators DO NOT hold the chair when you are about to sit.  I've had the chairs slammed into me several times, and it hurts!  I feel bad for the little kids who get hit!  This is a NO NO for ski s.  Slow the lift down when people are getting on. 

3.   restaurant cabin at mid mountain was dirty with floors that were entirely wet.   trash overflowed to the floor, and the restroom smelled terrible!  No paper towels provided at all in the restrooms.  I like to use paper towels to open doors.  re are too many people who do not wash their hands.

4.   main cafeteria needs renovation.  re are not even enough tables and chairs during lunch time.  

 only thing good about my experience yesterday was that it had snowed 5"" the night before.

Having no diamond runs open and worth skiing was a bummer,  but the the overnight grooming army made it a super fast and fun vacation  for us.

Not at all disappointed.
y really do have first class snow making   the size of the cannons have to be seen!
Yes it is small, but has some very nice trails, the artificial snow was not ""concrete"" like it can be in many places.  instruction was first rate (Sunday afternoon group lesson, $59 including rental and lift pass, me the only one in the group), and very chatty. Views really pretty.
An excellent mountain to visit if you are in the New York City area as it is not too far, and a lovely warm up if you are driving up to the bigger mountains in Vermont or NH. Well, for everyone up to intermediate level.
I would also definitely recommend this mountain if you are new to skiing, as it looks a great place to learn.it has 3 nice areas, easy green in front of the Lodge, a very nice set of green and easy blues to the left, and a lift serving the more difficult and longer trails to the right. All lifts have safety bars, so that is a big plus.

9537,2013-01-08,Vermont,Mad River Glen,5,"I ski MRG at least once a year and have been doing so for over 10 years. MRG is not a flashy  with tons of amenities. It does not allow snowboarding.  single chair lift can have a long line. Trail grooming is minimal. Snowmaking is done by  Almighty.  trails are narrow, steep, and sometimes littered with moguls. se qualities would be a turn off to most would be skiers, to MRG devotees, these are the exact reasons this mountain is beloved. In order to appreciate this  a skier must eschew modernity and embrace skiing as it was before steel framed lodges with drywall interiors, high speed six pack lifts, and groomed trails wider than a freeway. 

Whether you ride the Single or the fixed grip double to one of the two top stations, your choices about how to get down are numerous and the difficulty level ranges from a couple of green trails that traverse the , to a myriad of straight shots that will have you dodging trees and sketchy sections the whole way. I like to start by warming up on Upper Antelope before cutting over to  Upper Glade, Ferret, or Moody's, and then ski out the Lower Glade. After that, the rest of my day usually is consumed by seeking out trees, chutes, and bumps with occasional journeys into the green terrain when I need a break.

MRG is not all bumps and trees. In fact, the entire skier's left side of the the lower  is consumed with oodles of twisting greens and blues reminiscent of a Snakes and Ladders board game. Not only are these fun runs that can be used to access some great off piste terrain, but these trails are perfect for the kids and beginner skiers. A mid mountain double serves this area on busier days. Another double serves the somewhat separated learning area. I often wonder what it's like to be a kid here and grow up skiing this mountain. I hope the kids appreciate it. 

With no big amenities, there isn't always a lot to do for apres ski. Good local acts do play in General Stark's Pub. y also serve some excellent dishes and have a nice selection of local brew. Snowshoe trails also exist for those who want something other than skiing. 

MRG's snowboard ban is perhaps it's most controversial issue. Knowing the history of the  and the reasoning for it I support the ban to a certain extent, but I know a lot of snowboarders who would love to ride the trails here and are good enough and respectful enough to do so without it being an issue. Instead of snowboarders, MRG attracts a higher than usual amount of skiers that use telemark equipment. This anachronistic manner of skiing is just as throwback as the mountain itself, and thus embraced by the . It's just another thing that gives MRG a certain flair not found at any other , and yet another reason I keep coming back.

Its a decent size  for this area with short but fair amount of trails to keep you busy for a day, with a good variety. Advanced experts and tree runners may not feel adequately challenged (Cliffhanger is the only double diamond, though I wonder why, as it is just as steep and actually somewhat wider/easier than say    the  Hump or Marjie's).

Expect significant ice even after a snowstorm, and sometimes unmarked thin coverage patches on steeper trails which is dangerous.

2) Spring Mountain is a really great deal for cross country skiers.   In rolling terrain, you need downhill technique and Spring Mountain is the place to learn it.   Because they are OLD SCHOOL.   While some ski s now rush their students to parallel skiing based on the deeply curved trick skis, Spring Mountain still teaches the traditional technique developed in Europe:  snowplow, wedge turn, stem christie, then parallel.    technique used by the US Army and Marine Corps because it works for real skiing on real skis.    trick hourglass alpine skis are worthless for covering terrain    to cover 40 miles in a day, you need the straight sided skiis made by Asnes in Norway.   and to ski downhill on those, you need the traditional techniques.   Plus  the really expert alpine skiers    those who ski in the backcountry wilderness out west    value the old methods.   See Paul Parker's ""Free Heel Skiing"", 3 Edition, p. 66.
3) With Spring Mountain's lifts, A cross country skier can get more downhill practice in a day
than he would get in a month if he had to climb every hill in order to ski down.     instructors are good    mine showed me a subtle move that really helped me.

9629,2013-01-23,California,Bear Mountain,5,"Ill start by saying we did enjoy our time at Bear, the one time we went mid week early in the morning for several hours. Living in San Diego, we can get to Big Bear in a couple hours. I like the way the mountain is layed out   i also like the overall vibe. It's a nice looking  with decent man made snow. What really sucks about the place is some of the lousy attitude these snowboarders have. Il will totally single out the boarders, because i do not ski   i'm strictly an intermediate snowboarder. i only snowboard on the mountain. 
I think its pretty lame and rude for these boarders to sit smack dab in the middle of the runs. First of all it's dangerous not just for beginners, but for everyone riding and skiing. Just park it to the side. This is really evident in the jib park   we tried saying something to a couple idiot boarders and it ended up in a talking smack match   not really nice for young kids to witness. It's weird but i don't see skiers get into this situation and it sucks because i snowboard and i don't want others to think my girl and i are like these dudes. Completely frustrating. 
 lifts are another issue   the place gets soooo packed and once you get one guy who feels the need to act ""smart and cute"" it just gets all his friends and everyone else his mental age to do the same. This mainly happened on the weekend. Now as i said, we've also been to Bear mid week   and it seemed like a totally different place   very cool, calm and rider friendly. 
 prices for lift tickets and getting food definitely burned a hole in our pockets, but i guess that's how it goes these days at the park. We don't mind paying a little more if we're having a good/memorable time. But if youre having to dodge people sitting on the run, getting yelled choice words for asking them to move out of everyone's way, dealing with ultra packed lines to ride grandma's slow chairlift and dealing with rude people in line knocking into your board every time you move 2 feet, to most of us   that's not considered a really a good time.

9638,2013-01-26,Vermont,Killington,3,"My son spent 5 days during ""college week"" at Killington in the Pinnacle condo's. While the deal seemed good at first, it became readily apparent what was brewing when I (Dad) had to give them my credit card for any potential ""damages"".  We checked him in and at the start the place was a dump. While it was somewhat clean at first glance, after a few minutes the odors started to settle in, the mold and grime in the crevices became noticeable, etc.

But I was fine with that, as was he.  After all who cares when you're 19, right? So I picked him up and the place was actually cleaner than it was when we checked him in.  only thing we didn't do was run the dishwasher   we loaded it but there was no detergent. We also didn't make the beds as they had to be stripped and changed anyway. One of the managers actually came to the unit as we were leaving to ask how things went and I actually asked her about the beds and the dishwasher. We were told everything looked good.

So what do I get as dad for this?  A completely false $200 charge on my credit card a few days later.  When I called to question it, I was initially given the runaround and 'Nancy' couldn't even tell me what the charge was for.  Next day I get a follow up call and was told it was an ""extra cleaning fee"", that we left it ""trashed"". As I pressed for more details, it became very clear to me they were fabricating everything. I argued to no avail. and $200 to clean what is about an 800 sq ft condo? y have taken complete advantage as they saw an opportunity to pull extra $$$ out of Dad and I basically have no recourse.

9639,2013-01-26,Vermont,Pico Mountain,4,"     In a nutshell, Pico is an overall halfway decent mountain.  But with Killington 5 minutes away, it makes Pico feel small and boring.  re are few expert trails, and they're all short and icy.   grooming is terrible, I was skiing on what felt like pebbles  and this was with three inches of new powder!!!   one terrain park is super easy and is on a green circle slope.  It should be moved to a slope with a steeper pitch for more speed, and it would turn the current slope into a beginners paridise!  Every lift is old and slow, even the high speed quads.  I think the only reason Killington bought Pico was to connect the two and make Killington over 1,000 acres of skiable terrain.  Now that the connection has been abandoned, Killington should sell Pico and use the money to make improvements on lifts and snowmaking.  Don't go to Pico, spend the extra 20$ and go to the overcrowed Killington.",RatherBeSkiing
9640,2013-01-26,Vermont,Okemo Mountain,4,"We went to Okemo in March/2011 and did a Sunday to Wednesday trip.  Lift lines at that time were completely non existent, but I could definitely see the place being busy on weekends.  We stayed at the Okemo Mountain Lodge, which had a ski in/ski out great location.   rooms were definitely a bit dated, but I go on vacations to ride, not to sit in a luxury suite.   Spring House was a great little after skiing activity, it was just kind of a pain to drive there and then change into swim gear and whatnot (though that would not be an issue for those staying at Jackson Gore).  I really, really liked the terrain parks, and the pipe was in pretty good condition for the weather being what it was.  Overall, loved the place.  Tons of runs, lots of stuff that you can do with your kids and any other intermediate riders you might have in tow.  You pretty much had to go into Ludlow for food after the mountain closed, and there weren't a whole heck of a lot of options, but it was a very minor inconvenience.  Staff was also very friendly and helpful, especially when we got separated from our very adventurous 4 year old for a couple minutes.  I have not been to any other s in Vermont, but I can definitely say that I would almost definitely go back to Okemo next time we head up that way.   only reason I didn't give the terrain 5 stars was because I didn't really see an opportunity for much tree skiing or anything, but I also know that's kind of tough to come by on the East coast.",RatherBeSkiing
9644,2013-01-28,New Mexico,Sandia Peak,2,"Don't go there unless you are 1) teenager AND 2)snowboarder AND 3) beginner.
This area is notorious for attracting beginner snowboarder teens because it's cheap.  y will be crowding the runs, sitting on the snow all over the place. re always a lot of them. 
 runs are bad, shallow, and the snow is always of poor quality because snowboarders destroy it quick after grooming. Sandia doesn't bother grooming more often than once a week. So, good luck finding that velvet. 
Chair lifts are so slow (it takes 15+ minutes to get to the top) and very uncomfortable. re is no leg support and sits are very hard. Your legs will be numb by the time you get to the top.  lifts stop every couple minutes because snowboarders can never normally  get on and off the lift.
re is a short lift that intermittently works but the run under it is no worth trying, pretty much  a bunny slope. 
Overall: unequivocally, wins the 'worst ski area in New Mexico'. Doesn't worse even that cheapo money they charge for it.
Off note, snow patrol is very rude, don't try swinging your legs on a lift chair, they will clip off your ticket.",Anelizk88

9661,2013-01-31,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,4,"First visit to BM on 1/27/13.  Understanding conditions have been less than perfect for this region, with warm temps followed temps in the teens, the mountain was ok on some runs and borderline dangerous on others.  Little upset that my base is now completely trashed with deep cuts and scratches.  One long run was filled with ice the size of golf balls and numerous exposed rocks, so it was difficult to feel what I was riding on.   mountain itself seems large for the mid atlantic region with several good blue and black runs.  Staff was extremely friendly and I was surprised to learn that youth lift tickets are 21 and under, helping out the overall pricing for me and my 15 yr old son.  Also, the ticket system is automated with turnstile setups, so no delays with folks bar scanning you before getting on lift.  Seems like lots of newbies on this mountain, even on the harder blues and blacks, which can make things interesting when trying to enjoy a run.  I would go back, but only after a good base of natural snow and/or favorable snow making conditions.  Also found it interesting that much of the mountain was used for a racing event, the entire day.  Of course this part of the mountain looked to be in perfect condition.  Most other s seem to reopen race areas in the afternoon to everyone.",Brian Sloane

Stayed in Clarks Summit/N Scranton.  Easy drive up from there (25 mins or so), parking is decent.  y shuttle you from the lot up to the lodge on the back of specially built trucks.  It's a short round trip, and there was never a wait to get on the shuttle.   lodge is clean and comfortable.  Typical split for cafeteria/picnic lunchers, and as usual, the space between the tables is crowded and can fill up with gear, but nothing abnormal.  re are no high speed lifts, 1 quad and 6 doubles, so the ratio of lift time to ski time is a little high.  Conditions this weekend were great, 40+ inches of base, nice carvable powder on most runs, some good ungroomed steeps, and lots of variety.  I like that most of the approaches to the lift areas are plenty wide, giving lots of room to maneuver around those of all speeds and skills.  Lift operators were pleasant and professional, and the loading/unloading areas seemed to be well kept and smoothly operating, with plenty of room to get off the lift and out of the way of those behind you.  

Stomping grounds terrain park had some nice large jumps and good features, also well maintained by the park staff, and it's location alongside the Delaware blue square on the edge of the mountain keeps the traffic through the park down a bit, as you have to deliberately head over there, and it doesn't lend itself to ""drive by"" participants on their way to the lift lines as is sometimes seen in other parks.  

All in all, a well run ski area, lots of good variety (though limited vertical) and it could really, really use a high speed detachable quad or two to decrease the lift time and allow for more time on the snow.  ",Brian Sloane

Plenty of regular dumps, not very crowded, wonderful weather, fairly priced accommodations, and a great family time. We stayed over Pres Wkd, and never found crowds an issue.  fresh snow meant that the grooming, sporadic though it was, didn't really disappoint. re was plenty of mountain for every level, and we liked the fact that blacks, blues and greens intersected regularly, so we could ski to our own levels and still meet up easily. Nightlife was limited, or a 30 min drive to town, so this isn't for the big Apres Ski folks. We recommend Durango for almost everyone.  lodge upgrades are very nice, and the condos on the slopes are either new or in the process of being upgraded.",Anelizk88
9698,2013-02-10,New Mexico,Ski Santa Fe,5,"Ski Santa Fe is a great  overall.  We have been there repeatedly due to their great service and friendly attitudes.  We used their ski school in 2010 for our 9 year old to learn to snowboard.  Two days of lessons had him boarding with confidence.  This year we returned and he kept up with the rest of us without further lessons.

March 13 & 14, 2012:  after receiving 7 inches of snow a few days before, the skiing was very good but not great.    does a great job of grooming the runs.   groomed runs are very good skiing all day.  Other trails were generally frozen for most of the morning hours.  Several large and flatter runs (Sunnyside, Santa Fe Trail) got slushy in the afternoon.  Camp robber, a run on the far NE side of the trails, was getting bare and I'm sure will be closed before too much longer if no new snow is received.  Other runs on the East half of the mountain (Lower Burro, Alpine, Lobo, under Lift 7) are starting to show brown through the snow.

This was spring break, but the lines were not bad at all.  We never waited more than 2 minutes to get on a lift.  We stayed on Lifts 1, 2, 3, and 7 though.   other two are ""bunny"" type lifts and there was more of a line.  

My only complaint this year was lift operation.  y slowed the lifts a little more than usual and stopped lifts way too often.  Over two days I estimate we were stopped on lifts 8 times.  I don't like that and don't see much reason for it.  

Can't speak to the nightlife as we were on a ""family"" trip.  Santa Fe has a full gambit of restaurants though from the usual chains to great local fair.  I highly recommend Maria's for ""New Mexican style Mexican food"". ",Anelizk88

I would go as far to say: ""Keystone has the best tree skiing in Colorado"".   This is from my experience, but you can always find fresh tracks in the trees at Keystone in nearly any part of the vast acreage covered; as opposed to the trees that quickly become packed out at Breck, A Basin and Copper (other nearby s).

Keystone really has nothing going on in the village, other than the price gouging that is so typical of  villages.  Mind you, Keystone is owned by Vail Resorts, however it tends to be forgotten in the corporate turmoil that takes place annually (like an adopted child).  For you, and us locals, this means a bit of freedom (at least on the week days) due to less marketing.

To the left as you unload from the main chair closest to the lodge is a blue run with some terrain features off to one side, and also a pee wee rope tow at the bottom.  heavy family orientation of Snow Ridge and nearby Mccauley Mountain and Woods Valley have translated into local ski/race school institutions which have turned out some really good skiers over the years.  result is a population of very talented instructors who will spend time with you for a fraction of the cost of a teaching session on a big mountain. Snow Ridge is definitely a great place to learn. re is a well equipped rental shop on site, and other great options in nearby Utica at Bike&Board or Schuss

To the right as you come off the ramp of the main chair is a very wide open slope with 4 distinct lines down. Directly under the chair is a narrow trail which for the most part spreads its' vertical over the whole length. Directly next to that, and separated about halfway down by a stand of pines is a section that is deliberately left ungroomed. 

Watching the Utica weather report in the winter is such a predictable laugh: every night there is this white blue blob which extends off of Lake Ontario over the tug hill plateau. As a result. by mid February, barring any significant thaw, driving through Boonville and Turn on the way there is a real hazard due to the monstrous 10""+ snowbanks on the corner's. se place do start to look for all the world like the pictures of mountain towns out west.

So hitting that ungroomed area early in the morning is actually the best chance a skier has east of the Rockies for practicing three dimensional, edge free turns.  ""powder"" is of the low altitude variety, and freshwater at that, but the difference between it and a hard surface is striking and that smooth, gliding feeling is quite addictive and makes hounds of us all. This hill is perfect If you haven't developed these skills yet because above the tree stand you can always hit the panic button and steer to either the left or right and get to a place where your edges will work again.

Early is important however, as since the vertical rise is so paltry the fresh snow gets tracked up quickly even on a weekday when few skiers are there    but even on a moderate day you can find lines with a mostly fresh feel right up through to mid day due to the generous width of that part of the hill. (lines that you won't find, even on a Saturday, are at the lift). This pod never really bumps up because of all that snow until later in the season, but navigating the tracked crud in the afternoon is actually a great skill builder, and if it starts snowing while you are there (excellent probability on any given day) this place can easily get 2 or 3 or sometimes even 4 inches in less than an hour and the conditions will change so drastically and quickly that it is as if you crammed three days into a single trip. 

 other two lines on the northern part of the ridge are served by another ancient fixed double chair, and are excellent cruisers. One almost comical aspect of these lifts is the fact that the footrests have rusted off a good percentage of them.  hill crew takes grooming seriously and does a great job: full smooth corduroy will be found across  the ridge in the morning, but this is mostly edged over and often covered with new fresh snow by 11am.

One upshot of the puny vertical is safety: no way you are going to get lost and if you do get injured help is never far away.  patrols at Upstate local hills are all supplemented by volunteers who do it for free or discount tickets, so the ratio of patrollers to skiers is probably the highest you will find on planet Earth.

To the far far left from the top of the hill is some poorly marked terrain which the trail map does not do justice and which really should be rated double black. From the leftmost marked trail at the top ""Krukshank"", you have to keep your eye open for this one tree that will have a very narrow track off to it's left. This will bring you into a wide, steep, bumped up glade which ends with three choices: a narrow catwalk back to the trail, a very narrow, very steep gully that is more like a chute, or another 20 or 30 feet of steep bumps which dead end at a cliff (which I haven't yet scoped so I don't know the drop, although it is pretty clear from the tracks that others do not just stop at the edge ...). Bring your helmet.

re is a nearby low cost motel, and the Ridge owners also run a B&B and have developed some trailside ski in lodging. Lots of the locals brown bag and the uncomfortable hard plastic chairs in the lodge are vintage 1970's, as is the cafeteria food. re is a full service bar/restaurant at the base in an outbuilding which has a woodstove, fireplace, and food which isn't that bad.  Buffalo Head is a local secret about 12 miles to the south which serves heaps and heaps of fresh, well prepared American fare for a reasonable price in a welcoming, fun and family friendly atmosphere. Be prepared to be eating left overs for 3 days straight if you order either the prime rib or the cream pie, which you really don't want to miss...

 people you will find there are friendly but not fake, and very down to earth and unpretentious without being judgmental or prying. My wife refers to this place as a ""living snow globe"" and we always drive away with a major skiers high, even when we've had to rely on the kindness of strangers to help push us out of getting stuck in the parking lot.",OnEdge

9810,2013-03-05,Colorado,Breckenridge,5,"Visited on 02/15   powder day!  6 inches overnight and the snow continued throughout the morning.  Made for nice skiing, though the weather was pretty brutal at times.  To be honest, I now understand why opinions on this mountain are so divided.  Novice and casual skiers/riders will love Breck   the intermediate terrain on Peaks 7 and 9 is pretty wide and flat for Western blue slopes.  Advanced intermediates should look forward to stepping up to some of the black runs   Crystal, Centennial, American, Peerless, Volunteer, Shock, Callie's Alley, and Spruce are all within the reach of anyone who can carve a parallel turn and comfortably carry some speed.  Peak 7 is almost all wide, lazy, rolling blue cruisers and was clearly designed as an area for families.  True experts will likely find Breck a bore unless you're OK with skiing the E Chair and Imperial Express all day (and Imperial isn't always open).  When Peak 6 opens next year, it may give experts more hike to options.

 town is great.  A lot less snooty and fake than Vail or Whistler (not to mention considerably less expensive), easier to walk than South Lake Tahoe, and better for singles and couples than Keystone.  I recommend staying somewhere within walking distance of downtown and basing yourself here, even if you prefer to do your skiing/riding 30 minutes up the road at A Basin or Copper.",skinomad

9818,2013-03-06,New York,Hunter Mountain,1,"Went over the last weekend in Jan 2013. Paid $70 for an adult all day lift!!  I only paid $73 a day for Mont Tremblant in Canada during the NYE holiday.  Its a 2.5 hr drive from NYC, and though I haven't taken 1 yet, there are a lot of bus operators that do trips to Hunter from NYC. 1 way to avoid the outrageous lift cost is that the busses are a good deal, generally $80 90 for RT bus and lift.
On Saturday, it was really crowded. But the weather was quite cold, subzero the whole time. So they had the snow guns out the whole time, and the runs were quite good, as a result.
A good mountain for beginners, they have a whole section of lifts and runs for beginners, much more than other area mountains.  I guess this is to accommodate all the firsttimers from NYC. This can have its upside and downside, since some of the more courageous ones might clog up the more expert lifts.  Again, since its such a small mountain (compared to a place like Blue Mountain in PA), this can be a problem.",wedge2edge
9826,2013-03-08,Pennsylvania,Blue Knob,4,"Blue Knob is awesome.
Great runs, lots of choices, and an amazing ski school for the kids.  Great personal attention and old school charm.  Took my kids during NY state vacation week and found it empty because their normal draw is from VA and MD   who did not have the same week off school.  My 8 and 7 year old both learned to ski the first morning, and only got better with the amazing instruction they received the rest of the day and half of the next. Couldn't pull them off the slopes even when the snow picked up and visibility got bad.   Even my husband took some lessons to brush up and was so satisfied with his instruction!  We'll be back for sure... 
As for modern and posh amenities   not much has changed since I learned to ski there in the early 70's!  Charming for sure!

9832,2013-03-09,New Mexico,Red River,4,"I live in Colorado but have family in Texas.  We decided to meet in the middle in a lovely, or so we thought, town called Red River, NM.  It had been a long time but as a kid my parents had taken me there so I didn't remember much about the place.

As soon as we roll into town and go to get settled into our hotel (Lifts West) I knew something was up.   lady at the front desk was rude and acted as if I had somehow disturbed her from her t.v. show.  After an exchange about having to put a deposit on a room that I had already booked about 2 weeks prior, with no indication I gave in due to shear exhaustion of being on the road and wanting to just grab a shower and a meal.   room was fairly nice, but small and was extremely close to the lifts so that was definitely nice.

Next exchange came at a small mexican food restaurant that we found tucked into the back of some shops and what seemed to be local apartments.   food was decent but overpriced(kind of expected that in a small mountain town), but good god were the people some of the most rude I've ever encountered.  That was basically the theme of the trip.  Rude locals not willing to do their jobs but you really had no alternative.

 skiing was pretty dismal.  About half the mountain was closed and the half that wasn't was full of ice and out of control skiers.  I've skied some of the busiest days in Keystone/Breck etc... and never seen so many people ski like that.  I was glad I decided to wear a helmet and in retrospect I would've felt safer with my full face and body armor.  

y did receive some moisture while we were there, although it was in the form of rain making for a day shopping, or what I guess could be called shopping.  Most of the places I felt were a collection of gas station items with the exception of one shop that had pretty nice stuff, albeit at about a 25% markup from the prices you would see in many of the shops in Vail or the like.  

 highlight of the trip was a stop at the Lift House which was conveniently located between one of the main lifts and our hotel.  y had beer, they had liquor but not much else.  We decided to get out of there and just go to the hotel but ended up spending about 30 minutes trying to get the bartenders attention away from the locals just to get my tab.  I ended up leaving to go change and just let the place die down a bit, but when I returned it was twice as busy as before.  I don't like being pushy but I had to yell very loudly and complain to the bartender to get my tab.  I felt like a bit of a jerk but I certainly left no tip.

tldr;  I will never be going back to this town that's called a ski area.  re's no snow, the people are rude and obviously don't want you there and the prices are higher than some of the major Colorado s.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place if you have any intention on having a good time.",Alan M
9837,2013-03-10,Michigan,Boyne Mountain,4,"Great skiing!!! Boyne definitely does a great job not only caring for the guests, but also actually serving decent food!!  staff is more than happy to help us at any time of day whether it's getting another room key at 11:00 at night, or just asking for good off location restaurants (even though Boyne Mountain is somewhat remote) y make you feel right at home! the rooms are so clean i would be surprised to even find a little speck of dust!  only thing that's a little disappointing is the nightlife. On certain nights there is night skiing and there are a couple on  bars, but it's all very casual and family friendly. re aren't any fancy restaurants, all of them you can just walk in in your boardin' boots, hoodie, and snowpants! But that isn't exactly a bad thing, it sorta adds to the ""in the middle of nowhere, i don't give a dime for how my hair looks"" kind of thing. All of the restaurants are located right off the mountain, so it's more convenient for the skiers and boarders who just got off the mountain.  only exception to a disappointing nightlife experience is if you are boarding or skiing on a Saturday night. usually you can hear music blaring from every house, and the ones that have ""ski in, ski out"" access have speakers on their porches and are ""dj ing"" the night session. the only bad part about the night session is the whole back side of the mountain is closed. On certain holiday weekends, they set off fireworks from the top of the mountain, and they do a pretty good job! I would reccommend Boyne to everyone!!!!

9846,2013-03-12,Pennsylvania,Montage Mountain,4,"I'm a local. I go to Sno now 2 3 times a year. Since it changed names a few years ago some things have been getting progressively better. In the days of yore, then Montage, used to have a lot of great cheap ski deals mid week to bring out the locals. This somewhat ended when it became Sno, but thankfully it seems those deals are gradually returning. It's ease to get to from major metro areas is also very good. Yes, it is a bit further from Philly and NYC than other Pocono s, but with the exception of the last few miles on the access road, it's all expressway from the major cities.  upper trails (blues and greens) are all rather similar, but the diamonds on the lower part of the mountain are all very different and offer a nice mix of terrain.

Snowmaking is still a bit lax. When other Pocono s are blowing Sno sometimes is quiet. I don't get it. Yes, snowmaking is expensive, but considering the drought and high temperatures we had this year, any time to blow would have been welcome. Some nights when conditions were prime for making snow, the guns were off. Day skiing here is great but once the sun goes down the upper trails get crusty fast. This is common at many Pocono s, but almost guarantees to happen at Sno. Luckily the lower trails usually remain decent unless a bunch of noobs scrapes off the topcoat. This is common on the White Lightning and Smoke trails. ",village idiots

Trails were open as advertised on the website, however only two lifts were running when 5 were advertised. This was the bunny slope double and the express quad. Not a big deal since the express quad is the only lift you'll want to take anyway and all terrain is available from this lift, albeit with some flat ground traversing at the top.

Mountain was easy. Hardest thing there is probably an average east coast blue. Enjoyable through the intermediate level though. Biggest issue was the lesson my brothers got.  beginner lesson was extremely basic and did not include any runs on the bunny slope, just shuffling up the almost entirely flat learning area and coasting down. Given the low price of this mountain, I would recommend some sort of extended lesson as I saw groups of 2 or 3 going up with instructors on the bunny lift.

Loveland is massive and has somoe of the best views in colorado at the top.  bowls are small, but great and there is more than enough terrain to last a few days without hitting it all. If you have never been here its worth going it is a gem of a  for the money. Plus you can be back in denver that night for some needed rest or great nightlife!",40yrskibum
9936,2013-05-06,New Hampshire,Ragged Mountain,4,"I had been waiting all year for a good dump to provide the necessary cover to allow me to check out ragged and its ravine. With around 2 feet dumped Friday into Saturday I decided to make my way up to ragged Sunday. Some of the main entry ways to the ravine were closed as even a blizzard couldn't undo what the past two months of very unwinterly weather had done. I consulted with a member of ski patrol as to the best means to access the ravine and the conditions to be found there. After an initial run through the ravine, I decide to access it from the other side (skiers left) of the mountain as the line for the triple was considerably shorter than that of the six pack. Coincidently I ended up on the lift with the same ski patrol guy I had spoken to initially and he was very generous in sharing with me were some of the more choice lines and stashes could be found. Needless to say I spent all day in the ravine which offered a wide array of levels of difficulty from thinned and gentle, to tight steep and technical and everything in between. Overall this mountains great, I can't say much for the non gladed runs as I didn't spend any time on them, the bit of the park i did  see had some nice features, and the gladded terrain seemed varied enough in difficulty that parents could bring the little ones here to get a feel for the woods (there's also a blue glade on skiers right of the mountain which I imagine would be even easier however I did not ride it during my time there).

I have skied a lot of places, including top rated s in Canada and in the US Rockies, and Nubs could give them all a run for their money when it comes to grooming.  This is the best kept secret in Midwest skiing.
ir lifts aren't in bad shape, they're just slow.  Part of me would love to see them upgrade and put just one high speed chair in, however, I know that would probably draw more people, which would probably make it less ideal for skiing.  If you don't mind slower lifts, this is the ideal place to be skiing in the midwest.  ",tjkotula
9942,2013-05-31,Michigan,Boyne Highlands,3,"Disclaimer:  I'm an advanced skier by western standards.  I go to ski and don't give a flip about a """" experience.  and I'm bored to death on groomed runs, no matter how steep.  Also, I don't care one bit about terrain parks.

This place acts like it's the big kahuna for hotshots.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  EVERY run is over groomed, and there is no off piste.  and by that I mean there is NONE, official or otherwise.  A few places look promising but are utterly inaccessible.  This is a real shame because if they would thin out the woods in the North Face area they could have some killer glades.  Instead, they have the trail they named ""Black Diamond Glade"" which, is most certainly, positively, 100% NOT A GLADE!!!! It's a groomed trail same as the rest of this boring, overpriced , and it's not even steep!

 ""Tournament Pass"" area is probably the most interesting, but wait, what's that?  Oh, the Valley lift doesn't run on weekdays....so while I can easily get to that section from the top of Heather, I either have to ride the bunny lift for a traverse or hike all the way across the base area in order to do it again?!?  WTF?!?!?  y have the gall to charge $50 for a day ticket and they can't even bother to have more than a couple of lifts running!

Was pretty pissed because I showed up real pumped for some pow with my fat skis.  Wasn't even worth waking up early.  We have all seen snow reports that call 2 inches 4 or call 4 inches 7.  Calling less than an inch as 6 inches is criminal.  Not one to bitc#$% but someone needed to call them on it.

This mountain is HUGE and they get a ton of snow.  Beginners and Intermediates will be happy for days but the expert terrain is where this place really shines.   snowfields have always been a staple with the only above treeline skiing in the east, but if you want some unforgettable runs head into the woods.  re are glades everywhere on this mountain and there is something for every level of glade skier.

Even Sun Valley and Jackson hole were not this bad.   is spread out, and has a lot of lifts, but more are needed with the amount of peopel coming here.

It snowed 1 1/2 feet of that great one of a kind dry southern Utah powder over the weekend while we were there.  mountain has some fun expert areas and intermediate area's with a small park.  staff are the best and most patient i have ever met. I have two small children (6 & 2), so me and my wife took turns boarding while the other was watching the kids. We basically picked out the corner table in the upper lodge and made ourselves at home. Not only did they not mind on bit, the even helped while my 2 year old was having and offered my wife some apple juice. On the first day my 6 year old refused to ski with daddy since it was to cold and stormy out side.  manager let me return her rentals with a full refund, try doing that at Mt. High or Mammoth!!! Overall, this is a great  for families and those who aren't trying to ride like pro's and drop cliffs.  park was fun, but small and not very challenging. However i didn't come to Eagle Point to ride a park, i can stay in socal for that.  I came for tree runs, open pow fields, and fun little terrain drops and i got ALLOT of that while i was here with my family.  only con i can think of are the ski lifts. All but one are SLOW.  only  that i can think of that has slower lifts is Mt. Baldy back in L.A.. Since i came here with small children i can't really comment on the local night life, but the lower lodge had a nice bar and shuffle board table in it when i checked it out, plus hot tubs right next to it. Overall i have to say that this is the best deal any californian can get right now if you want to ride real powder instead of sierra cement and not pay an arm and a leg to get it.",Scott Larson

 elevation is very high up, so even though the snow was melting at the base, the powder was still plentiful up on the summit.

Let me start off by saying that Mt. Bohemia is NOT a family .  In fact, it's not really a  at all    and that's the way that I hope it stays.   On my first run, this place redefined Midwestern skiing for me.   terrain, snow and scenery are all incredible.  Bohemia does zero grooming, and also doesn't make any snow.  Yes, this does mean that late in the season that the snow cover can get, well, sparse.  However, it's totally worth it.

My visit was in late March of 2013, and it actually rained for the first entire day.   rain, combined with late season snow cover would have ruined a trip just about anywhere else, but Bohemia was still amazing.  Sure it was wet, and we were all soaked by the end of the day, but I was having SO much fun that I didn't care.

Be forewarned that lodging is basic:  cabins with bunk beds, a bathroom, heat and a fridge, or a ""hostel style"" yurt.  re is a bar yurt (the ""base village"" is a system of yurts), but other than that, there isn't a lot of ""apres ski"" type stuff at all.

10586,2014-02-13,New Hampshire,Cranmore Mountain,5,"I'm an advanced skier that has  been skiing for over 40 years and have skied just about every ski area in New England multiple times. First of all, a general clue about how to enjoy skiing is to avoid weekends and holidays. I almost never ski any area on the weekend or holiday period. I realize that is the only time some peolpe can go, or maybe they're a kid and that's the only time their parents can take them. But once you become independent and get control of your life, do yourself a huge favor and enjoy mid week non holiday skiing. It is night and day different than the weekend warrior experience. This review is from the perspective of someone who has skied Cranmore mid week at least 35 times.
 trails at Cranmore are great. Some ski areas have trails that all seem similar, like golf courses that make you feel your playing the same hole over and over again. at Cranmore every trail is unique. Someone actually put some thought in designing this area 70 years ago. Don't listen to ridiculous reviews that say there isn't anything for the advanced skier. re is plenty here for skiers of all levels.  This is a small to mid size 1200' vertical drop mountain, but it packs tremendous variety and lots of options to satisfy even advanced skiers. It is unlikely that you could ski every trail on this mountain, even if the place is not crowded. My advice is explore the whole mountain and then make a judgement, instead of skiing two trails and acting like you know what this place is all about. ",Annah Kim

Really friendly mountain, everyone is so helpful.  re was deep powder all over.  Temperatures were great. No frozen toes here. By 1 PM it had gotten tracked up even though it was still coming down in buckets. I still found plenty of untouched snow on less known runs and through the trees.

10601,2014-02-15,Pennsylvania,Camelback Mountain,1,"First time at Camelback and was extremely impressed.  Despite the 2 degree weather (F) during the winter storm (can't fault CBK with that), Camelback was worth the 4 hour drive from DC. We actually stayed overnight at the adjacent hotel (Chateau Resort) the night prior, which I recommend over trying to make a day trip from that distance.   Chateau Resort is unaffiliated with Camelback, I believe, but is 2 minutes away, parking lot to parking lot. A barebones  lodge; clean but in serious need of renovation. Unless you're simply looking for bed and 2 minute drive to ticket counter, stay in Stroudsburg 20 minutes away.

Crowds:  weekday crowd was low in the morning so only one lift was running from the lodge area to the top. Two others were open at other areas. re were no lines until noon.  I was surprised that they did not open another lift when as the crowd increased, but the staff was fairly efficient at controlling the lift lines and I never waited more than five~10 minutes.  Of note, many frequenters did admit that I was lucky to come on a weekday because the weekends get crowded enough to make the trip a waste of time.  

Terrain: Several reviews highlighted the lack of vertical (~800') at Camelback.  However the layout of the runs make the mountain bigger than it appears on paper. For one, it's difficult at the base to see the entire  within your peripheral vision; it's that wide.  Second, yes you can take the straight diamond runs down and it can go fairly quick, but most of the runs wander or switch back and link to other runs.  My favorite was the Nile Mile that I google earth measured at about 1.25 miles. It's a really fun blue.  A couple times I got to the bottom on different runs not really sure how I had gotten there. Also the bunny slope is separate from the rest of the mountain so no problems dodging beginners.  

Snow: Considering it snowed about 5 6 inches overnight augmented by snowmaking, I expected better conditions.  Most of the mountain was groomed hard. I only found one short section that was purposely ungroomed.  You could find fresh snow on the sides of most runs, but I felt they could have taken more advantage of the all night snowfall.  Still, with the small crowd I only started to run into infrequent ice patches on the steeper areas in the afternoon. I could easily see how a crowded weekend could uncover a lot of ice on the popular runs.   

Bottom line: I'll happily bypass the s closer to DC for a weekday overnighter at Camelback",village idiots
10609,2014-02-17,New Hampshire,Crotched Mountain,5,"Crotched is a rare GEM.  addition of a High speed quad really kicked things up a notch. A less than 4 minute ride to the new summit (10% taller!?) together with short liftlines makes this the place to go for lots of runs. I got in over 50 in a day & had time to do a lot more.  y went out of their way to increase the trail count & quality of their advanced trails groomed & in the woods. Overall much more appealing for adults now.  
Crotched is kid & family friendly. One central base lodge is the center of everything.  lodge is a bit undustrial (metal) but makes up for this with a good cafeteria, large bright clean bathrooms and free storage cubbies downstairs. As you expect in NH the staff is friendly, parking is good and of course there is a bar & fireplace. Crotched may be a little hard to find the first time, set your GPS & go.  bridge that was out last year in Francestown has been replaced with a temporary bridge simplifying access somewhat.

Sunglasses and t shirt under my shell by mid morning.  Sunny.  Don't know why more folks not taking advantage of the best ski season we have had in mid west in a decade or more.  Dummys!

Well, they have all the features on map going full blast.  Even the tree skiing is still good.  y only blow on the marked runs, naturally, but the real deal is still plentiful in the trees.   terrain parks looked in awesome shape for the boarders.  Some ""out west"" sized ramps/kickers to get some serious air.  I don't do air anymore, but surprised myself by catching a launch off a roller for about 20'   just didn't anticipate the powder drifted over the landing area, but that still made for a fluffy crash!

Lodge had the outdoor service bar going too.  I haven't been to a midwest hill that was in this shape, this late in the season.  If you're on the fence, check weather and Granite Peak web site to check conditions.  I believe they are staying open an extra week and a weekend or two.  Crowds are non existent as folks here have tired of winter.

Shoots off top of mid chair were in great shape.  I'm telling you, place was sweet.  I didn't mind no one around, but felt bad for the  not bagging more cash to make up for lean years.

 snow depth was accurate on web page   I think they have 4 6 foot base.

10856,2014-10-21,Idaho,Bogus Basin,3,"While I have ridden Bogus a lot, I am not blind to its faults. It has average snow. Many icy spots.

 good things about Bogus are it's proximity to Boise, about 45 minutes drive. It is very family friendly with good classes for all age groups. It also has some great nordic runs.

If you are just learning they have the magic carpet area which seem nearly perfect for that first time getting up on skis.   lift for the learning area gives access to an easy green.  By the end of the day see if you can manage Broadway.

 grooming and snowmaking seem to be top notch.   lodge is pleasant and food is reasonable for a ski area.  Any worker I had any contact with was pleasant and I chatted with people on lifts who either know the place well and love it or had just discovered and, like me, were pleasantly surprised.

This was a good ski season in the region and there was abundant natural snow in March before and during my trip.  re was a good mix of terrain overall and we got 9 inches of snow (powder) in 3 days.  re were quite a few flat areas where using poles or skating was required.  I was disappointed that one major lift (Powderidge) and 3 green trails were closed for the season starting the first day we were there.  I choose Snowshoe over another  because they appeared to have all their terrain open and there was no indication of this closure.  My wife was also disappointed that half the restaurants were closed and several shops were closed.  Although we had a good time overall due to the relative lack of crowds, we would have had a great experience if all the terrain was open.  My first impression of this place is that profit comes before customers.  Until something changes my mind, I will associate the motto ""if it ain't crowded, it's closed"" with Snowshoe. ",lname
11010,2014-11-30,New York,Gore Mountain,5,"We were at Gore the weekend of March 8 9, 2014.  We felt like we had stumbled on a well kept secret.  Our group of skiiers and snowboarders prefers to tackle mostly blues, with a few blacks thrown in.  We found some amazing runs that we wanted to go down again and again (Twister, Echo, Sagamore, Quicksilver, Fox Lair). We all agreed that Sagamore (a black) was the best run we had been on all year, and we were the only ones on it!  

We left our 9yo daughter at home for this trip and we were glad we did   there was very little terrain that she would have been able to ski, and those trails were spread out and separated by long, flat traverses (more on that later).   trail she would have most likely ended up skiing the most (Sunway) got VERY icy later in the day.  It also got very crowded   perhaps because it was one of the only beginner trails. 

 other cons would be a few of the lifts, as well as the long, flat traverses.  We have never had problems loading or unloading before, but this past weekend we ran into various issues   once the double lift going to the top of the mountain came careening around and clocked us on the back of the calf, leaving huge bruises.  Another time the lift over by Tahawus sped by, we all crashed into each other, and the lift operator was TOTALLY oblivious despite us screaming for him to stop the lift.  Also, the entries are not well covered and the exits are steep.  If you've got a kid who is still learning to use lifts, I could see this really being a problem.  It was also really a challenge to use the long, flat traverses to get between ski areas.  By the time we got over to Burnt Ridge we were exhausted.  Can't comment on Little Gore because we didn't go over there, but that's an even further hike so I'd imagine that's a real challenge.  Perhaps that's the place to be if you are a beginner?

We will definitely go back, because the pluses (non crowds, varied terrain) far outweigh the minuses.  But beware, this  is not all things to all people... you need to have a certain comfort and ability level to enjoy it, but if you have those things you really can enjoy it!

My family frequented the area when I was a child, so my wife and in laws decided to try it for a long weekend. Well   nothing has changed and not in a good way.  lifts are ancient (dangerous), when they are even on... For $72, you'd think all the lifts would be running.

We were continually promised they'd open them, but they didn't.  real problem was the actual runs that were open were terribly groomed and almost dangerous. This place does not have a high percentage of decent beginner runs to begin with, so I'd never take a small child down the ice chunk laden runs they do provide.

You do not have to be present,yes you may ski other slopes during their lesson.However you must have a cell phone if your child does respond to the lesson or having problems.I enrolled my grandgaughter who was 7 years old and never been on skiis.I was pleasantly surprised to see her performs turns thru pylons without falling + she rode the chair one time. instructors are very very good,they have patience,lots of humor and create an enjoyable learning experience for the kids.at the end of the lesson they receive a certificate to show what they learned during the lesson.  downside to Jack Frost is it's popularity which means large crowds on the week ends.Jack frost is a popular destination for the Philly Crowd.Alternatives are get there early for a 10:00am lesson not sure if there is 9:00am lesson.

11397,2015-01-23,Colorado,Telluride,5,"SNOWBOARDERS BEWARE! This review is from the point of view of an advanced level snowboarder.

  I have heard nothing but praise for the  so I was very excited to go there. Unfortunately it was a bit disappointing for me. 

First the good: As you have read in other reviews the scenery from the summit is stunning on a bluebird day.  town is great (but expensive) and much more fun to explore the restaurants, shops, and bars than aspen or vail. I had fun chatting with the locals at the bars around town. If you are a beginner or intermediate (maybe a few years experience) you will enjoy it very much. Lots of beautiful, mellow to moderate groomers across the lower mountain, and you can go to the top of most of the lifts to enjoy the views and still find easy ways down. If you are a skier who enjoys bump runs the upper mountain has great bump trails in the trees as well (not great for snowboarders). 

Ok so now for the bad. For me, an advanced level snowboarder, the mountain terrain wasn't holding my interest. I am a true ripper, I love long, open, and steep trails to shred from top to bottom, most boarders do.  None of the trails here were particularly long (compared to places like aspen or snow mass) and waaaayyy too often I found myself traversing a long catwalk across to another small lift area as opposed to riding down the mountain. It takes several lifts to get from one area to the other. Although it has 3800 feet vertical the only trail that actually goes that length is a long winding cat trail from the summit and once you get down to the base it take 3 or 4 lifts to get back up.  telluride base area had a couple good long blacks but they don't go the full vertical and it takes two very slow lifts to get to the top. Also, despite what people have said, I found it to me more crowded than the aspen mountains. at Ajax highlands, and even snow mass I had less time waiting in lift lines than I did at telluride even during the week. 

However if there is a powder day I think the bowls are steeps on the front face would be great. re is plenty of hike to terrain that looks like it would be very exciting for thrill seekers and extreme skiers. However unless you happen to book a vacation during a snowstorm you may find yourself board as an advanced boarder. I would recommend the aspen mountains over telluride even though the town of telluride is way better. ",horse

11415,2015-01-26,Pennsylvania,Eagle Rock,5,"I saw that this  was the highest rated ""family friendly"" and had to chip in.   downfall of this place for ""family friendlyness"" is that there are no absolute beginner slopes.  re are parts of the easiest green slopes that are very steep that you have to traverse to get to the lift.   snow on these steep parts was also thin and you could see the brown dirt on it   some extra snow and grooming for these steep parts would have been helpful.  I saw two beginners from other groups lose control down the steep hill and go over the snow wall and wipe out in the dirt during my brief time there yesterday.  Also it was so steep that I could not go down with my youngest, we had to take our skis off and walk down.  Even to get to the green chairlift, there is a very steep hill that runs right into the queue (again with a lot of dirt showing).  As a comparison, I had no such problems on the easiest slopes at other s with any of my 3 kids when they were first learning   Camelback, Whitetail, Jack Frost, Liberty, Wisp   everywhere I've been has been more accessible.  Also comparing weather and slopes, we had been to Jack Frost the day before, and there were no dirt or bare spots, and my 3 year old could handle the hills there and asked to go again, but he and my 5 year old beginner spent the rest of the day in the lodge at Eagle Rock after our experience on the greens there.

Also for a high family friendly rating, I would expect an area for 3 4 year olds to ski independently on a very slight slope, such as a lot of places that have carpets, and the kids' camp areas, which my 3 year old enjoyed.  Eagle Rock did not have these.

A big pro is the lessons: y are a good price, the instructors are kind and attentive, and they offer lessons to younger children.  My 8 year old enjoyed his lesson and grew his confidence.  Also ages 6 and under ski free, which is a wider range than some s.

 cafe was unprepared for the holiday weekend, and seating was insufficient, but still doing a little better than other area s.  re were a lot of non skiing extended family members in the lodge taking up the little seating that was available compared to other s.  This is fine, but for a slope made for property owners, they should know their membership and plan accordingly and allocate more seating.   food quality and selection at the top lodge was mediocre, and we couldn't get the family to the base lodge because of closed trails (and I was the base lodge ""looked closed"" on a holiday weekend).  Several trails were closed on the holiday weekend, including the only green that went down the whole mountain, plus the only blue.  Still, lines were short and you could get many runs in the few trails that were open on the foggy day that we went.

 staff was friendly and it's a cute small .  If you have advanced beginner skiers, or want to take lessons, it would be good, especially if they opened more trails.  Also our blue level 8 year old had fun finding his way off piste near the (minimal) terrain trail.  But until they do something about the very steep hills and grooming in the green area, I wouldn't call if family friendly.",CompanionCube

11438,2015-01-30,Minnesota,Lutsen Mountains,5,"Hello,
My brothers and I had just come back from our annual 4 night 4 day snowboard trip tradition. and this year we came to Lutsen  for the first time (we go on a trip every year and have been looking for a place to call home each season and have not found one yet), and I thought that I would give you guys a review for you to go over. re were both good things and not so good things to report about our experience to Lutsen...

Pros: Everyone was very friendly and helpful at the . everyone that we met either in passing or at a counter were very helpful and friendly...people would say ""merry Christmas!"" and others would simply give a friendly smile and nod. Thank you for making us feel truly welcome at your . That was refreshing. A big highlight for us (from a service perspective) was that the rental shop allowed my younger brother to keep his rental at our hotel for the entire stay without having to return the board/boots at the end of every day...that was fantastic, and saved allot of time in the mornings and afternoons. We also loved the Caribou Express...my brothers had never been on a high speed chair like that, it was great to be able to get to the top of the hill that quickly...very awesome.

Cons: I have 2 of them...1) Although we have had a terrible snow season so far I think that there could have been a MUCH better effort to be able to make some sort of terrain park available for those of us who like to go to big s to get some ""big air"" action...there was not one single jump manufactured...I am extremely disappointed in this. Since I myself have allot of experience, I got bored quite fast of riding the same runs over and over without having one single jump to hit. My brothers are from Detroit Lakes MN and when we got back from the 4 day snowboard trip (which is the highlight of every year for us) we did one evening at the VERY small Detroit Mountin (which is really just a foot hill) but at this hill they had a full out terrain park with large jumps all the way down one side of their mountain. y packed in as many jumps and rails into one side of the hill as they could...I had more fun in one evening on a bunny hill than I did the entire vacation at Lutsen (that is not an exaggeration). I love to hit big jumps and I have traveled to many Mountain areas in the Canadian Rockies and just because a  says it specialises in back country terrain doesn't mean that they just abandon all the park riders. I was extremely disappointed that there was no REAL terrain park...just Mogen with 3 boxes...that's not a terrain park. and I was even more disappointed when I saw that Detroit Mountain had a bigger park with LESS snow. So snow conditions cannot be blamed for no jumps.
2) re is no night skiing available...we left this vacation feeling like we spent more time in the hotel room trying to find something to watch on cable television than we did snowboarding. In the mornings we had to rush out of breakfast down at the  then rush to our hotel, grab all of our gear and make it for 9:30 to get on the opening lift because you guys close at 4 PM!! We couldn't even have time to go back to the hotel to eat lunch because by the time we had got back to the hotel, got all our gear off, and cooked our meals...we only had like an hour or so to get back on the hill. That was not relaxing at all. We were at Spirit mountain last year for our annual trip and were able to ride until 9:30 PM. We were able to wake up in the morning have a relaxing breakfast and lunch AND have a great time because we knew that we had all the time in the world to kick back and enjoy a great snowboard trip...unfortunately this was not the case with Lutsen. I understand that you cannot feasibly light up all the mountains, but you could easily do Eagle mountain, and create a large terrain park to keep riders and skiers busy until late in the evening. Because any park rider knows that you can hit the same large 4 jumps a THOUSAND TIMES and NEVER get board. If you have just plain old runs available you're board of that one run in 3 or 4 rides down...no adrenaline factor in that.

In closing I would like you to know I am in no way trying to leave the impression that we hated the trip, but I am saying that it was not worth it for us to drive 6 hours from our home (and have my youngest brother save his money for 6 months to go on this trip) and pay for all the accommodations, when we could have easily driven 3.5 hours to Duluth and hit up terrain parks, and runs all day, and evening; and pay allot less for our trip. 

Again, thank you for your hospitality. But we will not be returning again until there have been changes made. We were hoping Lutsen was going to be our annual spot... looks like we will be going to Spirit again next year.",lukedborg

11520,2015-02-11,Colorado,Silverton Mountain,4,"Silverton Mountain is a hard core obsessed ski mountaineer/60's hippie/backcountry skier's playground.   appears to be ran on a shoestring budget, with a schoolbus shell converted into a building with a 60's peace symbol spray painted on the side, plastered with skiing stickers, and a semi permanent tent which serves as the ticket window. 

This is true Level 9, serious/no messing around, no nonsense, OMG extreme terrain   the kind of skiing that most ski s would close or never permit.  top line of the legal agreement that skiers have to sign states ""You Could Die Today""...actually, a 25 year old women fell 1,500 feet to her death on the very same day that I skied Silverton. ir heli skiing helicopter doubles as also flight for life, which can shut down heli skiing at a moment's notice. 

 typical Silverton Mountain regular is a hard core backcountry/big mountain skier or snowboarder, who might spend 6 hours hiking to get in one perfect run. He might live in his car or a tent nearby and is very self reliant, independent and in many cases, a loner or have a small tribe of fellow comrades. A lot of ski bums, spiritual seekers, thrill seekers, and adrenline junkies flock to Silverton. 

Silverton is a place ran by hard core hippie backcountry skiers, not corporations. It appears that Silverton is ran by big mountain skiers, as a privilege for other big mountain skiers, but not necessarily for profits. Aspen and Vail are at one end of the spectrum, Silverton is at the other end of the spectrum   bare bones, primative, rustic and no bull   take it or leave it. Trail signs are written by hand.  ""ticket"" to heli ski is a single loop of duct tape around the forearm of your ski jacket. Extremely low tech to the quaint point of occasional disbelief.

I am a bona fide Level 8 skier, assessed by several ski instructors. I have skied for 34 years, I frequently bomb ski runs down the fall line and have been GPS ed at consistently verified speeds of over 55 mph. re are no double black ski runs that I cannot handle at the ski s in Summit and Eagle Counties. I carve around gates and am up for anything, even in bad snow conditions. I own three pairs of skis. While I am not a huge backcountry skier, still I am no idiot.

Yet, Silverton Mountain humbed me. 

Friend of mine and I heli skiied and made it down two runs, in very icy, rocky, snow brick chunk conditions, and it was harrowing.  ski runs here made Beaver Creek's Golden Eagle look flat by comparison. Breckenridge Imperial Bowl is a blue run by comparison to Silvertons OMG off the charts steep drops.

I did one heli drop and one run unguided skiing. You catch the helicopter at the top of the mountain, requiring a 15 minute hike from the lift, up about 45 feet in elevation. Pay attention when getting off the lift   it is a sharp 45 degree drop that will wake you up real quick.

This is not a groomed , this is Grizzly Adams on skis.  dense glades are full of downed trees, stumps, underbrush, exposed rocks and plenty of things to tear up a pair of skis or a person. 

If you can ski ANY and EVERY double black diamond with relative confidence, and if you have been assessed at Level 9 skier, and if you like to hike, then Silverton is your place. If there is plenty of snow coverage across Colorado, and after a medium to massive powder dump of at least a foot or more, then a Level 8 skier can handle Silverton. Anyone below a Level 8 skier is truely courting death if they attempt Silverton.  easiest open ski runs are 45 50 degree angles. I have no doubt that there are 65 degree slopes, as well as cliffs at 90 degrees. All go on down the span of the entire mountain, very long and very steep. 

at times, I was in disbelief that they were letting people ski some of the most wild and extreme conditions. You need to make sure that you can handle it.

Also, Silverton Mountain is recommended only for people who live at an altitude of least 5,000 feet, not for out of state lowlanders. Hiking at 12,000+ feet requires some good lungs that can handle the thin air and lack of oxygen. 

Tips: 
      
1) Honestly assess your skiing ability or better, have a ski instructor assess your level. This mountain is not forgiving. If you hit a patch of ice on a 50 degree angle slope that rockets you over a cliff and land you on top of a rock field   then you are toast and will die a very painful death, and there is simply nothing that you can do or how hard that you can edge. Choose your line carefully. If you are afraid of steeps, then this is not the place for you. A big bad ass ego is not worth dying for.

2) If you have backcountry experience, ski hike to terrain and big mountain skiing, and know your shit, then this is your playground.
 
3) Wait for a deep powder day to prevent the above from happening. With runs this steep, you really need some snow to grab onto to for your edge to grab and stay in control.

4) Ready and study their website, every tab and page   there is really good stuff in there.

5) Plan your trip. If you live on the front range, Silverton is a 7 hour drive. 

6) Bring your fat skis and preferably A.T. ski boots with A.T. bindings for hiking.

7) Bring your Go Pro helmet cam and take a ton of pictures and videos to blow away your lowlander friends.

8) Be self contained, bring your own water, food and anything that you will need. Do not rely on anyone. No one is going to take care of you.

9) Do not expect too much in terms of a ""ski area"". Silverton Mountain not a . Silverton staff are generally nice   but can lose their patience very quickly and are simply not in the mood for anyone to cross them. If you want ""customer service"", then go to a .  staff are not in it for the money, and have nothing to lose. You will not win an argument with them, just be patient and know that you have what you have, it is what it is.

10) Arrive early in the morning, preferably between 7:00 am to 7:30 am; afterwards, it gets to be a real cluster cluck while people fill out forms and move from line to line. 

11) If possible, try unguided skiing first so that you can do your own thing   just research the mountain well and choose your lines carefully.

12) Listen and pay attention.

13) Make sure that you know how to self arrest (stop sliding down the mountain if you fall). 

14) Have fun, be confident, but be safe. Stay safe. ",JP

11632,2015-02-26,Pennsylvania,Blue Mountain,4,"I never been to Blue before so I decided this past Friday to check out their night skiing.  price was pretty reasonable, $35 from 4pm 10pm, but naturally it was a night so it's a bit hard to see. I also was informed by the lift ticket salesmen that buying the tickets online will save me time and money. Even though the conditions were terrible (not necessarily Blue's fault) I decided to try that the next morning, and my experience went completely down hill (not in a good way).

I live about 90 minutes away so went to their website at 8am, only to find when I try to buy the tickets their website brought me to a systems error page. I tried that for about 45 minutes and then I decided to call, which I was on hold for 40 minutes, only to be hung up on as soon as the representative answered. When I called again I was on hold for 30 minutes and spoke with a representative named Beth. She said herself she gets a lot of calls about that and there is a special way to navigate through the website to avoid that error, and she also said she wishes the website was formatted a bit easier.

I told Beth thank you for your help but I don't want to pay for the full price since I was navigating your tough website and on hold for almost 2 hours. She agreed and tried to get a supervisor to authorize a discount but ""none were available and there was nothing else she could do.""

On a Saturday morning, the busiest time of their week, no supervisors were available? I will not be returning to Blue Mt for a very long time. re are plenty of other mountains in the area that are a lot easier to deal with and communicate with. Beth may have done all she could, but her staff let me down. Not worth $70 to ride for a few hours on ice.",Robert Oliver

 layout of the mountain sucks. re are trails that everyone gets funneled into that get very icy. re are only a couple of blues or greens at each lift, so if you want variety you have to constantly move around the mountain which is terrible do to the horribly long and flat traversing trails.

Great lodge with friendly staff, Bar is great and very reasonably priced for adult beverages.  Food is pricey but so is it at any  so not really a ding. We bring a cooler full of bottles of water and lunch and keep it along with each ones boot bag in the little cubby holes they have spread around the lodge. I love this about the place, most of the other s you have to either leave them outside or on the floor in locker room. Big Bear is good enough to have these spaces all over for you to put your things. and since they are not locked you could run the risk of theft but never seems to be an issue here.

I would highly recommend this place for young kids and early skiers. If your advanced then this will bore you quickly. Still a fun getaway.  and the community its in you kind find houses for rent for weekends, long weekends and week.

11798,2015-04-18,Vermont,Killington,5,"My first time at Killington yesterday.  snow was terrible, compact granulated snow, iced over except under trees cover.

What I disliked the most is their map. Trails are all over the place crossing each other everywhere, it is so confusing.

y do have some interesting slopes for advanced skiers, lots of moguls, nice trees trails, lift lines and even a pretty fun free ride slope.Unfortunately a good number of these features was closed due to the snow condition and what was open was not that fun because the snow was so hard.

I don't know about apres ski since it was a day trip for me.
ir day pass cost is outrageous, $92! A day ticket at La Plagne, one of the best s in the French Alps is about $50 and it will cost you $74 I believe in Alta Salt Lake City. I took a bus out of Boston area and paid less bus+group ticket than what the ticket costs, in other words I will never go by myself if I go again. If you have to fly to get there, Utah is a much better option for better skiers but within a few hours drive, it is a viable option.

I was surprised that there was no wait at the lifts, just a little at the K1 eggs but overall I never waited more than a few minutes anywhere, not bad for a Sunday.

Overall I'll only give it a ""Fair"" rating because it is so expensive. I would otherwise give it an average rating, because it is average as most of the skiing quality you get in New England compared to the Alps or the Rockies. ",papi6022

Not the kickers, but the knuckles. Knuckles should be rounded and the pitch of the landing should match the whip of the jump. se are foreign concepts for the Mad River crew. y build massively over whipped kickers and long, sharp knuckles without much runup. ir landings are shaped more like quarter pipes than a rolling knuckle. Overshoot by a marginal speed and you will land flat. Catch knuckle and you will bounce one time and then land on the flat. Rails are good though (probably because they don't require shaped landings). I've gone to Mad River for years and the only hittable jump they ever make is for their Big Air Contests.

What has made skiing at Wachusett less enjoyable is the staff.   staff portrays a culture of being discourteous, impolite and apathetic.

12105,2016-01-02,Illinois,Chestnut Mountain,5," very first thing to understand that it's not a hill   it's a ridge with the lodge at the top and the Mississippi river at the bottom.  y bill themselves as having the largest vertical drop in the lower Midwest, which is true.  What they don't say is that a lot of it is very, very steep.  If you're an adrenaline junkie, you may enjoy feeling like you're going to hurdle into the Mississippi, but it was nerve racking for me.  I'd say a lot of it is more intermediate to advanced than beginner.  I think it offers some of the more difficult terrain of the hills within east driving distance of Chicago.

Snowboarders love it, and the terrain park is self contained with its own lift.

Every ski  in Michigan lacks vertical.  Caberfae is no different.  It has more then most which is an improvement given the prices are reasonable.

 not so good: 
  main lodge is a mess. Folks are allowed to come in the mornings, push tables together, and leave their bags. When people come in for lunch all the tables are empty but occupied with coolers and ski bags.   really needs to put a stop to this and start moving those items to a bag storage opening up the tables to people who are PURCHASING lunch and are looking for a place to sit.

  main lodge menu needs a revamp.  food tastes similar to a high school cafeteria. If they want to keep up with other northwest s a better, healthier menu is mandatory.

   two high speed quad chairs need more staff. On Saturdays and holidays the lines are poorly managed. People cutting and charging through lines making for a very unpleasant experience. Most northwest s have some one managing the lines were they merge to give skiers/boarders a better experience. Even little Bluewood does a better job at lift line management.

Most of the lifts at Red River are old school two person lifts which can be intimidating and challenging for the little ones and beginners but the staff will happily slow down the lift at your request.  Red River Resort is a small mountain.  As a family (with kiddos ages 9 and 7) we were able to ski from top to bottom (mostly blues and straight down  Face) in less than 10 minutes.  During the week, the lines were minimal and it seemed at times like we were the only ones on the mountain.  Leading into President’s Day weekend, the  traffic picked up considerably but not so much that the mountain ever felt crowed.  re is a beginner’s terrain park with small jumps and rails.   terrain park running under the Platinum Chair showcased Red River’s bigger air boarders and skiers.  We did not have a chance to run but a couple of blacks which were quick and to the point.  Overall, Red River is a really good family mountain for beginners and intermediate skiers/riders and for those who just need to get a quick ski/board fix as it is the quickest drive for this Texas family to decent snow.",Chris Comer

Squaw and Alpine Meadows merged with great fanfare several years ago.  This place has been deteriorating ever since.  A good example of this is their treatment of the Alpine Meadows area.  Current management consider this part of the mountain a backwater.  No investment in lifts, facilities etc. Alpine is almost never 100% open.  Often there are no advanced or expert runs open at Alpine, despite an abundance of such terrain there.  last time I was at there, they closed the mountain at noon.

It's well worth the little time it takes to research the businesses in Bellaire because you will find some gems (check out the Bellaire Smokehouse) and to research the surrounding towns and villages (e.g. Charlevoix, Petoskey, Traverse City, etc.), wineries, breweries, restaurants, nature sites, shops, etc. if you want to get out on a day trip.

Online it said 6 lifts open and 40 trails open, so we were looking forward to a day of skiing...I noticed on the way there was barely any snow. ONLY 1 LIFT (amer exp) was open today, and only 1 trail to ski down from it (with dirt, rocks). Very disappointed, because the online lift status was a lie. I've skied at Stratton x 9 yrs and value a 's integrity and fair dealing with customers. Other people were saying the same. One gentleman said to the staff that  he has season passes and he wasted his  day driving here when the mountain was un skiable, why not post an honest report? Along with other angry skiers, we went to the window to ask for refunds (no refunds), where the staff were smiling and 1 was even laughing...saying the lifts were closed due to ""high winds"" (which were not high today). It was obvious there was little snow. We have no issues with spring skiing, but report REAL conditions. This may be our last time to come here. We told our family and friends to be beware of Stratton's online reports. Don't post open lifts and trails when they are not open.

No one speaks aprés ski, although you can find broasted chicken in the nearby village of Crescent Lake, and I'm sure there are bars that open late in Oakridge, if you don't mind the wood smoke. 

But, the mountain! It's a small mountain with only three main lifts, logically laid out, which means you can get from anywhere to anywhere with just a lift ride away, and there isn't a single trail that isn't worth trying. Trails range from about 0.6 to 1.5 miles.

For beginners, Duck Soup is a nice, long run to start with. For honing your carving skills, By George is a very wide trail that's an even keeled 20 degrees all the way down, and Rough Cut is a more variable alternative. If you want more variability, Rosary Run in the front and Where's Waldo in the back (which is actually North facing) are decent width choices with only little bits of flats.

In the end, Willamette Pass is for advanced/expert skiers and boarders, and you get your money's worth with $49 lift tickets.  black trails are ungroomed, and arranged from easy to hard as you go from east to west, on front and back, ranging from about 25 30 degrees to RTS's infamous 40 45 degrees! On powder days, be sure to show up first thing in the morning, as things get tracked out by lunch, but those first runs will be the ones to remember, as it's never that crowded there. On weekdays, you may be the only one on that trail! Just make sure you know how to handle crud and bumps. Backside trees can be gnarly. Success is a flat 30 degrees all the way, often icy or bumpy, good for perfecting your steeps form; it is on a lift line, so people will be watching you. Northern Exposure in the back can be messy on top, but mellows out into a nice run.

Some cons. Powder is almost always wet and heavy. It rains there more than it should.  bunny slope and back side are often closed on weekdays. y are sometimes understaffed; ski patrol coverage can be uneven, and sometimes a lifty is missing. re is only one express lift, Eagle Peak Accelerator. Route 58 east of Oakridge can get pretty foggy at times, and there are a lot of trucks and very impatient locals. Snow can get pretty choppy after 2 pm. When driving through Oakridge, DO NOT EXCEED 35 MPH!

Some pros. Wind is much gentler than at Bachelor.  front side is south facing, which means it softens up nicely and evenly when it's sunny. You don't need backpacks, since you can park very close to the lodge if you arrive before 9 am. All that rain means that the road is often ice free (but it can also be deceptively slippery). Lift lines are super short, even on weekends; often, you can coast right up to the loading spot. Boarders and skiers get along well, and there are few obnoxious people. You can often find a good powder stash on the sides of groomers.

I have found the staff friendly and knowledgeable, with some who have skied there for decades. Be nice and friendly to them, and they will be nice and friendly to you. Be demanding, and you will get a baffled look back, which is a typical Oregon thing. Food is the usual burgers and fries and some other things I don't eat, but they do have a good collection of teas!",Jeff Wisdom

I was very disappointed that the Nastar area was closed. I am not sure why, because it looked like it was in really great shape. It was roped off and no one was skiing on it. Too bad since it is a really great run and I won't be able to get back this year.

In fact, some of the blues seem a little steep which might scare beginners. Staff and visitors were all courteous and respectful. re are A LOT of beginners, but hey, everyone has to start somewhere. This is a good place to learn. Besides, all of the people falling makes for fun obstacles...  only time beginners are frustrating are when they cause the lifts to constantly start and stop.

13265,2016-12-21,Massachusetts,Wachusett Mountain,4,"Wachusett's best purpose is to be the gateway for beginners. It is very close to home for many people, it has a decent ski school, and is nearly all beginner terrain. I like it because it is a great first stepping stone into sking and allows people be a little bit more prepared for the larger mountains. Intermidiate/ Advanced skiers who come for a quick evening (there is night skiing) or day trip will notice, ski patrol is extremely strict and acts a bit rude about speeding and wooded terrain. Although, it is not the greatest mountain, for most skiing at all is better than nothing.",lname

I normally do not rent on the hill but had to rent for 1 child today.  Was very disappointed in the rental process.  Long lines and inefficient.  One window at the rental shack during peak hours on a holiday weekend is incredibly poor planning. After 25 minutes had to go in and speak to the manager to try to get more people. I spent more time in line waiting for a pair of skis than i did taking 8 runs.  ,radtkej08

A man approached me and offered me life saving tips shortly after he helped me recover one of my poles and skis. Turns out he was an instructor at Waterville Valley named Kim. Kim demonstrated enthusiasm, patience and a passion for what he does to the point where it inspired to be more like him. He stayed with me and encouraged me even though i continued to fall off my skis,and cheered me on when I succeeded which helped me eventually regain my confidence and I was able to make it all the way down the mountain. He spent about 30 minutes with me and continued to instruct me throughout the whole thing. To be honest that man was a life savor. I offered him money or a beer  but he said that wasn't necessary. Kim demonstrated an impressive skill in skiing instruction and a love for what he does, and I will probably never forget the favor he did for me.",local skier

Terrain closures are so prevalent here(all in name of saving a buck), the skiing suffers.  Skiing is crowded every day due to such closures.  Here it is January 2017, and despite abundant early season snowfall, KT22, Squaw's flagship lift, has not yet been opened.  Got KT?  This place doesn't.   Squaw faithful must be up in arms about the  management.   current ownership is ruining a once venerable ski destination.  Hmm... kind of parallels the S.F. 49ers fall from grace.

13715,2017-01-19,Colorado,Wolf Creek,5,"Wolf is the place if you like tree skiing and powder. Not only are there vast amounts of powder stashed back in the trees always, but it snows here so often you have something like a 50/50 chance of landing here on a powder day when every single run is coated with 4"" or more of white gold.  trees tend to be far apart, so you can ski down through them almost anywhere you want, designated tree runs, non designated, and even in between runs on the near side of the mountain that has a lot of cleared runs. re is a lot of variety, so if cruising open groomed greens and blues is your thing, you will find plenty of that to sink your teeth into also. re are also extremely steep double black chutes and bowls and tree runs too if challenging your limits sounds like fun. Something for everyone, but especially tree addicts and powder hounds.

Maybe Monarch is trying to increasing business for ski tunes.

He called the , explained he needed a gift card for skiing and paid with a credit card over the phone. NO conformation was sent. NO tracking number was issued. He waited for 2 weeks and called the  again wondering where the gift card was.  answer was ""we mailed it"". So it arrived on 12/24/2016.
Yesterday (02/04/2017), we decided to go skiing. As much as I love skiing, I disliked that  from the moment we arrived. After  spending 1 hour outside inline to purchase the tickets (we could not do it online bc we wanted to buy lessons),  we were told that we COULD NOT use our $440.00 CAMELBACK  gift card to ski. 
So we went to Guest service to complain. My husband explained that when he called to purchase a gift card, he specifically said he needed a gift card for skiing and the girl over the phone said ""It was good for everything: skiing, water park,  etc"". Well apparently she was VERY unprofessional. So after arguing back and forth and spending 45 MINUTES, we got ""approved"" to buy our lift tickets etc.
LESSONS.  We both took lessons. Long story short. USELESS, UNPROFFESIONAL lessons. After spending 90 MIN with my instructor Nancy, she told me to hold my poles a bit higher. Seriously? I am a pretty bad skier. I have NOT learnt anything and she had only me and another woman in the group! My husband learnt how to stop and THAT'S IT.  I was beyond disappointed. I learnt everything I know from watching youtube videos.
EQUIPMENT. UNSAFE. We had to go back twice bc they did not adjust  the ski bindings right. While we were inline waiting, other people were complaining about it too.
I fell down once while skiing, so when I got up, I could not continue skiing, bc my ski bindings STOPPED holding my ski boots into the skis. So I had to get down the mountain carrying my poles and skis. 
Overall, what  a horrible company !
I would never suggest anyone going and skiing there.

14044,2017-02-21,Vermont,Pico Mountain,2,"It is with great sadness that I have to write such a negative review of this facility.  Our family lives in NJ and our children learned to ski at Sugarbush.  Ever since, we have been skiing there each spring yearly for over a decade.  In 2019 we were unable to have our family ski trip due to the closing Sugarbush during the Pandemic.  We purchased three Quad Passes to prepare for our annual trip.  Sugarbush has only extended the use of these passes a few weeks into the 2020 2021 ski season, to be used prior to 12/24/20.  It is not feasible for our family of 5 to plan a trip on such short notice.  After several e mails with the manager, Rob, we were informed that they will NOT extend the use of the passes for the entire 2020 2021 ski season.  We can certainly use these passes prior to May 2021.  Based on the lack of the use through out the entire season, my family will be losing over $1000.  Sugarbush did not offer any refund ( full or partial), or no consideration for use past December 24.  We are extremely disappointed in the lack of understanding, deficiency in flexibility and greedy behavior exhibited by this multimillion dollar .

14052,2017-02-21,Idaho,Silver Mountain,5,"What a pleasant surprise! I read a couple of so so reviews and came to the mountain with very low expectations. While the lifts are indeed old and slow, the terrain and conditions were excellent. This mountain has some great tree runs on skier's right and in the middle, while to skiers' right, access to some incredible steeps and powder were accessed by free cat rides featuring cool Driver Rick (Sunday only apparently).  staff were universally friendly and lift ticket pricing was excellent. Easy access for sure, although the 20 minute gondola to reach actual trails was a tad long. Food prices were a nice revelation   dirt cheap. I have to confess, despite being a snow and steep snob, with over 65 s to my credit, I wouldn't trade a powder day at Silver for 50,000 silvers! Lol",Jaden Rodriguez
14053,2017-02-21,Idaho,Silver Mountain,5,Nice to be able to ride gondola to top of the mountain.  Water park at the base is great for the kids.  Snow report is very frustrating /inaccurate conditions.  y measure snow totals on top of the mountain on a stake that gets wind drifts. ....very odd.  I brought the kids up last week on Friday and report says 3 inches new snow when it was solid ice everywhere.  1 and last year of season passes due to inaccurate snow reports. ,Jaden Rodriguez

14077,2017-02-24,Vermont,Jay Peak,3,"Skied Feb 16 and 17.  Most lifts on wind shut down on feb 17 so unless you like beginner runs, you wasted your money.   lift report said 100% open but no lifts to access any upper mountain trails.  When I asked for them to honor our tickets the following day, they said no because their trail report is accurate because it doesn't assume you need lifts because many backcountry ski without lifts.  So basically you can subsidize the uphill hikers/ skies with your ticket.  y are hiking for free after all. y need someone to pay for it. ",crowleylouis

14108,2017-03-02,New Mexico,Sipapu Ski and Summer,4,"Just got back from Sipapu. Overall impression is good. Get there early. Parking fills up quick on the weekends and the morning rental rush will take you a while to get on the mountain. A lot of new rental gear. Some of my friends had new out of the box boots. Very nice. Once on the mountain, the lines are super quick at the lifts. Staff is super friendly. A couple kids in our group took lessons, loved the teachers and were on the lifts the same day tearing it up. Steep learning curve for first timers and beginners like myself.  beginner slope where lessons are held is very lightly graded. My 3 year old loved it, but couldn't build up much speed. But once you leave that, the practice slope is steep and fast. No real in between slope.  green runs are pretty steep as well with tight trails. I am a super green snowboarder, so i found it difficult to get control around traffic in the tight lanes. Especially with how steep it was in some parts. Was told some sections on these greens would be blue runs at other parks. I did progress my riding a lot this trip, but it was tough. Brought our own food, but the food served in the cafeteria looked good. All in all a great experience. If you are an experienced rider, you will have a blast. If you are a beginner or still green and looking to progress, be prepared for some difficulty. Mountain is beautiful.",David Milford

Of their 5 lifts, they had their bunny lift and one other lift running, due to, i can only assume, mechanical failures.  What a terrible  that they can only have 2 of 5 lifts working when they have plenty of base and snow.  I asked the lift operator if there were any other lifts running, his response was, ""I don't know, why don't you go find out"".  A seriously bad .

14145,2017-03-11,Pennsylvania,Elk Mountain Ski,5,"Elk mountain is easily the best ski  in Pennsylvania for mountain terrain and interesting runs.  It is situated on the highest mountain east of the Alleghenies with a summit of 2700 feet.  According to my altimeter its vertical from the summit ranges from about 930 to 975 feet, and 17 trails drop the full verticals.   intermediate trails are long and two of them are twisty and so much fun.   expert, black diamond trails are quite steep for as much as 750 of the vertical and are challenging without being scary.  Three of the expert trails usually have bumps and the upper part of the steep, bumped Tunkhannock trail can be difficult.   grooming generally is very good and I rarely have found the trails to be icy or frozen granular.  Its high elevation and location in northeast PA mean Elk receives more natural snow than other Pocono areas.  views from the summit range far and one could think you were in Vermont.    main drawback to Elk is the slow, old lifts which cut down the number of runs one can take. Come on, Elk, at least replace one lift with a fast fixed quad.  Also, Elk does not seem to have as many snow guns as competitor areas and it can take too long early in a snow drought season to open all of the expert trails.  Elk has an ungenerous discount for senior skiers.  One day a week a senior can pay $25.  However, at Camelback and Blue mountain skiing is free for over 70 seniors.  As a result, my 70 plus friends rarely go to Elk since they can ski for free at its two main competitors even though Elk has more varied and interesting runs.  For someone who wants to ski at Elk for multiple days there are no nearby large hotels.  However, the absence of slopeside residences and hotels and the planting of hundreds of hemlock trees give the ski area a rustic and pristine feeling.",Ray Baucum

I would normally give a 5 star rating but we went this past Saturday (2/25/17) and were disappointed with the conditions.  re was plenty of snow but it had not been groomed in several days.  Icy and hard snow pack in many areas.   snow from the previous Monday had softened due to warmer weather during the week and colder weather came in Thursday and Friday and froze all the snow.   It made for fast conditions but the speed always came unexpectedly going down the trails.   powder on the sides of the trails which are normally fun to ski into had become crusty.

14433,2017-08-12,California,Heavenly Mountain,5,"A group of 11 of us went on a ski vacation to Lake Tahoe and skied Northstar, Squaw and Heavenly. Squaw and Northstar were great in every respect and we would, definitely, recommend the areas to our friends. Unfortunately, we can not recommend Heavenly as we found it under patrolled, under managed and quite frankly unsafe. On the 9 of March, I was skiing up to the lift entrance at mid mountain, next to the restaurant, when a boarder came out of the trees and smashed into me, knocking me out of my skies, breaking my glasses which cut my face. We had not seen a Ski Patrol or Mountain Ambassador all day.   Our group tried to hail the reckless boarder and were told to F    O  , he was in my way, as he slid into the lift line for the protection of his friends. When we road up the lift, we could smell grass being smoked by the three Blue Jacketed Ski Instructors on the lift. When we reached to top, on of the Instructors wanted to know ""what our problem was, as they were off duty."" at the base of the Mountain, a ski instructor with a group of beginner children was swinging his polls in the lift line an hit one of our group. Our skier asked the ski instructor very politely to watch his polls and the instructor replied, ""Hay man, what's your problem?"". In addition, there were groups of boarders sitting on the ground at the lift exits and in the middle of several of the trails.
We mentioned our various experiences with several skiers at the airport and back in Vermont and several had had similar experiences at Heavenly. Its, really, too bad as it was a great place to ski several years ago.
We look forward to skiing Squaw, Northstar and some of the other great ski areas around the Lake Tahoe area but NEVER SKI HEAVENLY AGAIN as it is much TOO Dangerous!

Its over priced, if you're not in the race league, then advanced available terrain gets taken up. If you're into terrain parks, get ready to feel like thats lacking as Bristol doesn't truly invest into progressive features and is 10yrs behind in their builds. If you snowboard, the  now has this elitist ski vibe and you do not see youre average 1 4 times a season family on the hill anymore. y cannot afford to go to Bristol. Season passes are now well over $800, which is more then what I paid for my Sierra Tahoe spring pass and Peak Resorts season pass together. Food in the lodge, get ready to take out a second mortgage if you bring youre family.  Bloody Mary is over $14 and thats well vodka and the weakest garnishes you'd ever imagine.

It's all commercialized now and does not feel like the once traditional hill that I remember. It seemed all about the $$$$. Unsafe conditions where skiers left their skis all over the trails (most green runs) were the most inexperienced skiers were riding. I watched skiers jam themselves into liftlines causing overcrowding and using choice language in front of children as ""reasonable"" people fought for what they considered their rightful position within the liftline. I witnessed the staff laughing watching these people argue and swear at each other. I spoke with one of the staff members to ask them to help control the lines and bring a little order, but my comments were ignored. It's all about how many people to get up the hill and not about the safety of your riders.

So I Pizza my way to the edge of this thing feeling pretty good, it’s almost lunch time. As I approach the edge of the mountain, I realize this drop off is better suited for bungee jumping than skiing. I can’t remember but I think I might of actually seen someone bungee jump off this thing. But there you are, at the edge with your friends who betrayed you, about to ski down Big Emma.

15004,2018-02-08,New Hampshire,Waterville Valley,2,"I've been coming to WV for years. Back in the early 90's it was pretty meh, but it's come a LONG way since then, especially the past 5 or so years.  expansion of Green Peak was really necessary to bring WV up to par with the other larger(st) NH s. Just based on what I skied last year along (only about 1/2 of Green Peak), it gives the skier options as the rest of the mountain got somewhat boring. I'm a fan of the older, narrower trials and really can't stand the wide open trails many large s have.  thinning of trees in glade areas and the new glades at Green Peak, along with trails like Periphery make WV worth the short trip from the Boston area. Especially when it's much more affordable than a place like Loon, and way less crowded. I think if they ever expand to the village with a gondola it would really improve the apres and make it a truly destination . Regardless, I believe it's the most improved ski area in NH.",Robert Kalantari
15006,2018-02-08,New Hampshire,Waterville Valley,2,"Ive lived and Snowboarded all across the East Coast and Whiteface is by far my favorite Mountain. 3.5k ft vertical, by far the most in the East. Its a true vertical, unlike other mountains that cheat in this stat with separate base areas, Whiteface only has one base, and it flows beautifully. 

 trails are so unique, none are the same, each have their own character, unlike other s that have a grid like layout. Lookout mountain is the gem. Hoyts High, Wilmington Trail, Lookout Below, some of the best trails in the East.  summit is spectacular, the views are out of this world. Never been on the slides, but I hear they are amazing, just another plus to add. 

 Cloudsplitter, 10 mnt div, and high country glades are amazing as well.  only negative is it is windy which can blow away some powder, but thats the magic of hoyts high, the powder usually ends up there. and overall I wouldnt say its more icy than any other east cost mnt, theres always a good amount of packed powder.  snowmakers also do a great job. and shout out to excelsior  another A+ trail.

15060,2018-02-19,New Hampshire,Gunstock,4,"I had a great first experience at Hunter. Dropped my 4yo daughter for the morning kids program (her first time) and I went and skied. It was a Saturday and the weather was great, so it was pretty busy but lines moved along nicely from the main base area. Skiing Hunter East and North as the day wore on and the crowds grew was the way to go. Much shorter lines. I picked my daughter up at noon and she had a blast. y did a great job with her and after lunch she wanted to ski the entire rest of the day. 

Overall a great experience. I do wish they had better green options outside of the learning area. I can see it being tough to transition someone from the bunny slopes to the big mountain as there's it's a sharp increase in difficulty. and the hills can get very crowded, though again skiing the back side helps with this.

15142,2018-03-03,New York,Hunter Mountain,4,"This review is a terrain review only. Use it if you wanna know where the good trails are.

Hunter Mountain is really good if you can hit it on a weekend or after a storm. re are only 58 marked trails on the mountain, but there are tons of hidden paths and trails that can range from easy winding paths through the woods, steep chutes, or big cliff drops similar to western terrain. Only downside is that these ""secret trails"" can only be skied midwinter when there is lots of snow. Or after a good storm.

 marked terrain is good aswell. Hunter has plenty of advanced (black diamond) runs off the main face and even two off the top of Hunter One.  black diamonds are really fun and not too difficult, so strong intermediates can ski them.

re are also plenty of double black diamonds on the main face,  4 in total (one glade). y range from your average catskill double black (Racer's Edge) to a downright terrifying 15 foot drop in to a 44 degree steep mogul field (Lower K27, and I'm not overexaggerating that number, it's been calculated on google earth, and the snowmaking makes it steeper.)

 west side of the mountain is home to the longest expert runs. None of them are as steep as Lower K27, they are only 28   39 degrees, but they are long and really fun. re are 5 of them (3 trails, 1 glade, and 1 unofficial glade that is pretty much an official glade at this point.)

Hunter One is home to the beginner runs and also has two black diamonds and some solid intermediate terrain.

Intermediate terrain is Hunter's shortcoming, but they are adding 5 new blue squares next year that have a vertical drop of 1100 feet, as much as the Hunter West blue squares.",Nate Moen

Rather than a gondola they should've invested in expanding the mountain and trails and more snow making equip. Most people don't like man made snow however being the southern most ski  in the US it's expected. Mt.. Expansion with more expert and novice trails would provide a better experience and allow the mountain to compete with some of the Colorado ski s.

When we went to pick up the equipment on day 2 we were told we should not have returned the equipment because the staff would have to readjust the bindings for the skis. Pico needs to make sure the various departments communicate better. Pico should come up with a consistent policy regarding the multi day equipment rental .

It’s the local mountain that gives great value and offers respite from the crowds on otherwise crazy holiday weekends. That being said, I was just there on Presidents’ Day weekend and there was never a wait for a chairlift even though the locals said it was “busy”. Great apres ski with an outdoor fire and watching ski racing in the afternoon. My only demerit and it’s a big one is that there was no entry beginner terrain. Usually there is a meandering green that’s great for beginner skiers, but most of the greens here had some steep blue sections that derailed our entry green group, 8 kindergarteners.  bunny hill is terribly overcrowded though they have a carpet on one side and a tow rope on the other.

We got back on the mountain and boy was it cray cray how fast the time went by. We enjoyed the terain parks although my daughter was alittle scared that a passing snowboarder going at lightning speed would run her over. Before we knew we had to leave for I had promise my wife we would be home to dinner. We left with hot choclates and bundles of joy. In the car we each said what our favorite part of the day was.

15843,2019-01-18,Vermont,Magic Mountain Vermont,5,"re's an awesome old school mountain here with mostly original trails (no regraded mile wide fields) that wind through woods full of marked and unmarked glades.  lodge is cozy and for a ski area has good reasonably priced food, but the Black Line Tavern is the crowning jewel there. Magic doesn't over groomer, but there's always fresh till on most of the beginner and intermediate runs, with enough beginner bumps around to be fun but not obtrusive. For more advanced skiers, expect to find everything   Magic isn't afraid to let you ski some of the best woods, steeps, and bumps in SE VT but there are also tilled runs. Note that they have less snowmaking than a mega , but much more than they had five years ago   don't expect 100% trail count for Christmas without lots of natural. But when they get natural, it's fantastic, not least because I was skiing nearly untracked trails easily until noon on a 30"" dump with a serious liftline. 
By serious liftline, I mean 10+ chairs waiting, because Magic caps lift ticket sales and has fixed grip lifts   this keeps the hill uncrowded and honestly if they had a detachable 75% of skiers or more couldn't ski all day.

re's a reason this place is called Magic. Because it is magic. If you ski in the NE, if you want a classic mountain experience, if you don't need a bubble chair and a spa to have a good day on the hill, ski Magic and find out for yourself.",Magic Mann

15854,2019-01-19,New Mexico,Sipapu Ski and Summer,3,"This is our first ski trip to new mexico, we come to Sipapu for it's cheap price and their slogan of family friendly. But we are wrong, we should not come here and will never again. and I would honestly tell my friends to find some other place. Here is why:
1, rude stuff. We booked a private lesson at 3 pm. y said we just wait at the base area at 3 and teacher will find us. We were there from 2:55, and till 3:15, none of our teacher showed up. (We booked 2 teachers) wondering why, I went to their lessons booking office ask what's going on. One of the teacher is in there chatting with the booking lady. When I asked, the lady suddenly yelling at me "" teachers are human, they need to go to pee!!!"" and slam shut the door after I come out with one teacher. I knew teacher need to pee, but nobody told me, we waited their for 15 mins and nobody come to tell us that the teacher will be late. and the lift stop at 4 pm, so only 45 mins left to the one hour class. As a customer, I think I have the right to ask what's going on. and you can just tell me they are in the restroom, not yelling and slamming the door at your customer.
2, bad lessons. After the late start, the teacher took my son to the kids practice place. Half of the time he is talking to other people. I saw my son waiting on the side not knowing what to do. He just asked my son to do the small slop again and again. Not too much instructions. After the 45 mins class   more like 20 mins since half of the time he is talking to other people. My son still can not do a good turn. My son was in their two hour group class the day before. ir class looks cheap, but 55 dollars for a 20 mins private lesson is more expensive than other place. Avoid the private lessons, it is not worth it.
3, not family friendly. ir slop for beginners is one very flat one and a very steep one, there is no middle ground, it is very difficult for a beginner to transit from the flat to the steep one. and their lesson office has strict rules to not let people getting in their office.  outside temperature is 0 degree Fahrenheit, and there is one or two families in there office, all the other families have to wait outside. and even they have three people handle the lesson booking, but there is only one computer, so all three people can only handle one family at one time. Even the room is half empty, all the other family have to wait outside in freezing weather. and the wait was very very long, like 15 mins for one family.",mpemail

It gets very busy on weekends so beware, but all in all, east mountain is excellent! y state on this website they do not have black diamonds, they do actually, and very challenging ones, On the one Blue trail, exhibition, they have regular skiing and moguls, then you go over 2 trails to steeper black diamonds Thunderbolt and Challenge, then off to far east mountain, don't worry they have an out, snow chute, of you don't take it, you will have to face the double black diamonds which are not on the trail map, they list them as Black diamonds, they are not, the second you get off the lift you are met with a ""double black diamonds,experts only sign, so I figured I would ski it,  I went down at first which were black diamonds, then was left which was a 40 or 50% slope the rest of the way down which was met with a glade. What a rush, From beginner to expert you will find this mountain a blast! After you get tired at Jack Frost which closes at 4PM, you can head over to Big Boulder, 50% ski terrain, 50% Terrain Park.

Unfortunately it hadn't snowed in 5 days upon our arrival so anything ungroomed had moguls the size of small cars...nothing wrong with that, however just be aware it's a challenging mountain for intermediate and below skiers.  You don't think of Jackson as a mountain with groomers, however all the groomed terrain was in great condition and despite a lack of snow prior to our arrival, you were able to hold an edge quite well on all the groomers.

16432,2019-03-06,New York,Belleayre,1,"It took us TWO HOURS to rent skis at the Belleayre rental center last Saturday. Worst experience I've ever had at a ski . Let me try to summarize the variety of problems. First, you need to wait on FOUR different lines to rent skis: ticket line, computer line, boot line, and then ski line. Second, there is no one helping anyone navigate these lines. You just have to figure out by asking other customers, ""What line is this?"" or ""What line am I supposed to go to first?"" Third, the rental process took 75 minutes, most of it spent on the line (literally out the door) for skis. Fourth and perhaps worst, they have a ""system"" where you wear the boots while they fit the skis, and they size the binding to the boot by ""scanning your boots"". This is fine if it works, but it has to work 100% of the time. After our 75 minute ordeal, we got on the gondola to the TOP of the mountain, only to discover that my daughter's bindings were sized to the wrong boot! So after consulting with employees at the top of the mountain, we then needed to get BACK on the gondola, return to the base, carry the equipment back to the rental place, and then have them fix the equipment. and when we did, there were TWO OTHER customers with the same problem! We arrived at the mountain at 9:15AM, but we didn't actually start skiing until 11:15AM, two hours later. Just unbelievable. ",Michael Lee

I do not ski, so when I bring my grandson up, he's alone.. since when do you tell single riders that they have to have a partner to ride the lifts?????? When he came back to the car , very upset and told me what the guy at the lift said to him, I stood at my car and within 5 minutes watched more then 15 people singly get on the Panorama lift, that's not even counting the other lift where there was too many to count. If that's the case your guide should be asking everyone to pair up to ride. You should be ashamed that you have people working there that will single out young riders and make them feel bad and upset them. I just dont understand how that is allowed....",Michael Lee

Skyelark. Upper section is blue, lower is black. This should be switched around.
Lower Pipe Dream should be a black. 
All of great bear should be black.

Great “real” town (not fake ski village) with really good restaurants and lots going on. Skiing is excellent on Baldy but it’s not a beginners’ mountain. It’s a skiers mountain with a huge vertical drop and tough terrain that is perfect for level 6 or higher skiers. Snowmaking is prevalent to make up for the historical early season lack of snow (although this year the snow was great).  Novices will better enjoy Dollar Mountain. but there isn’t much terrain diversity or vertical on Dollar. But for families there is a ton to do other than ski: tubing, ice skating, sleigh rides, snowshoeing, sledding, and a free bus service that takes you anywhere around Ketchum and Sun Valley. Bottom line: our entire experience was simply first class.

Special note on the Sun Valley Ski School   It’s on the expensive side, but worth it. Really professional and friendly staff and an excellent program for kids. Our 8 and 10 year olds LOVED their experience with Sun Valley Snow Sports at Dollar Mountain.

Here it is, February 20th AND NO ONE FROM CAMELBACK HAS CONTACTED ME.   title of this post should be TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CAMELBACK DOES NOT CARE.

Please, people, spend your vacation dollars with a Lodge and a hotel group that values its customers.  Camelback was one of the most indifferent, least customer service oriented experiences I have ever had on vacation.

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE

I checked in on Thursday and checked out on Saturday.  I called the Wednesday before to set up ski lessons for my son.  I had actually called 3 weeks prior also.  I was told each time that I had to be onsite IN PERSON at the hotel to set up lessons.  It took me 35 minutes and 3 transfers from the lodge to the mountain to get this information.  I was told that lessons were set aside for lodge guests.  So on Thursday, I went to the desk for lessons and I was told that there were none available until Friday evening at 6pm.   mountain was closed on Thursday, due to rain, but how was my son supposed to ski on Friday without lessons?  As for lessons being set aside for guests, don't believe it.  I felt that I received no consideration as a lodge guest.  I had no choice but to take the time offered.  I went to the front desk and I was told that lessons are set aside for sales on the day of the lesson, which would be on Friday.  I was told to go to the main lodge/ski area and ask when they opened at 8:30 on Friday morning.  I did this and was told at the main lodge/ski area that this was wrong and there were no lessons available at all.  More misinformation and misdirection from the Camelback staff.  Finally, at 10am, I went and stood, in the snow and waited to see if anyone cancelled a lesson.  Joe was able to squeeze in my son for a lesson because someone did not show up.  I had to pay an additional $90 for a private lesson, but at least my son would have one lesson before hitting the mountain.  This was too much work.  This is my vacation and I received the run around and had to work like crazy to navigate the system and the misinformation to get a lesson for my child.  This on top of spending over $450 a night to be a lodge guest.  You receive no consideration as a guest.  I booked here because the hotel and the skiing was all in one place, but the entities are treated separately and they don't work together and there seems to be a resentment between the groups.  Hotel personnel kept saying, ""Oh, that's the mountain."" and the mountain kept saying, ""Oh, the hotel is mistaken.""  re is no cohesion between the groups. 

Also, there was an underlying attitude of, this is just the way it is and we can't help you.  Really?  It was frustrating and upsetting .

17230,2019-12-31,Colorado,Copper Mountain,3,"Had a great day skiing but super disappointed that at the end of one of the more expensive days to ski, it took over a half hour to exit the free parking lot. Yeah it's free, but you get what you pay for. Seriously, why is there no one to help guide traffic. Real bummer.  Also only two Electric vehicle charging stations, which sucks when you use most of your juice to get to the mountain and then you have a problem driving home with no juice left.  I talked to guest services about both and was told, yeah leaving the parking lot is a pain. Was also told, maybe 2 or 3 years before they add any additional EV charging stations. Copper get with the times, more and more people drive electric vehicles. You need to up your services!  Breckenridge has LOTS of EV charging facilities.",Brian undefined

17246,2020-01-01,Maryland,Wisp,1," Wisp is a decent skiing area for all skill levels. I find the snow quality better than in New England on average and the terrain will keep you entertained for a day or so. Access is very easy. Just park your car and walk a few steps to the bottom of the trail from where the lift will take you up. Except on holidays there is usually not a long line at the lift. 
 view of the lake from up top is a nice touch. 
 area is small compared to what one would be used to from some of the areas in the west or in Europe and the lift tickets are not cheap. I still come often since I live close and I always have a good time. 

In Summer there are various other activities in the area such as an artificial wild water course, mountain coaster (open in winter too), Mini Golf and of course boating on the lake!",Anna Smith
17260,2020-01-01,California,Kirkwood,4,I skied here in the mid 90s and covered most of the mountain in one day. I am intermediate so didn't attempt to go down the wall. However I was able to enjoy the bowls on the right side of the mountain and spent most of the morning on the left side.  snow here is greater than most places in the US in volume on average so accessibility can be limited during storms. y have been trying to develop the area more for years but its still difficult to get to. Well worth it if the conditions on the mountain and roads are good.,Rick Hunter

Two runs had snow, and one of them has half of it blocked off reserved for sledding. Only working lift is shared with sledders, making it busy and causing it to frequently stop when loading or unloading. Basically 2 20 40 ft wide tracks down bunny hills.

17347,2020-01-06,Iowa,Mt. Crescent,1,"I came to try this place out while visiting Omaha and was thoroughly disappointed.  main lift (see ""Double Chairlift"" on trail map) that would access the majority of the terrain was not open, speaking to locals I learned it has been broken down since the start of the 2018/2019 season. Owners have stated that with how old the lift is it has been difficult to find repair parts. re were two runs open, Easy Street and Showboat. Half of showboat is reserved for sledding.  one lift moves very slowly and is shared between skiers and sledders so it frequently stops when loading/unloading. ir website advertises ""100% chance of snow!"" and I guess that was technically true, but even of the terrain that can be accessed by the lower lift about 10% of it had snow on it at all, and there were some bare patches. Essentially it was two 20 40 foot wide patches of snow with about a 150 ft vertical drop, one of which is partially reserved for sledding. If you live in the area it could be an okay place to learn how to ski but that is the only value of this place as long as they continue to make the bare minimum of snow and not get the main lift fixed.",Cliff undefined

Just be aware that it’s also full of park rat kids who give dirty looks, cut you off, and litter. But the terrain is kind of interesting compared with other regional options.

17449,2020-01-14,Washington,Stevens Pass,1,"I'm disappointed to have to leave this review, as a long time rider and pass holder at Stevens to see how it has changed under Vail's ownership is sad for the ski community as a whole, it's difficult to pick one area where the experience has become less enjoyable but easier to say that this year the whole operation seems disorganized, overpriced for the services provided, and some of the staff are downright rude and inexperienced, .  redeeming part is that the terrain remains the same for us who really only like to ride powder days on the steeps and Vail (hopefully) cant do anything to mess that up.
I have had 2 separate exchanges with lift staff that were uncalled for this year and one with a ski patrol guy who told me to ""stick to the groomers"" while I was trying to find some soft snow through the trees off Hogsback, hardly technical terrain for a moderately experienced rider.
If Vail expect people to pay the money for the Epic Pass and ride groomers they're about to see a major drop in revenue from that customer base pretty fast.
We have options in this State where we can ride and this may be the last year I pay up for a season pass, I already have a bad taste in my mouth for paying this year.
I love Stevens and have based my whole work life balance around being near there to maximize my time on the mountain,I bought a home near there, try to work close by and live for the best days up there, Vail cant change the fact that I just love to ride, but they are doing a great job changing where I want to ride.",undefined

17466,2020-01-17,Minnesota,Lutsen Mountains,4,"I visited Lutsen a month after I'd been in Park City, and I had scaled my expectations accordingly.  So I was blown away at how good Lutsen is for the Midwest.  In all ways it sits between the no vertical ski hills of the Midwest and the actual mountains out West, but it manages to deliver something that feels more like the West than I expected.  It has a lot of great intermediate runs, including all the blues and many of the runs labeled as single black on their map, and their snow management is really very good.  

Lutsen is privately owned and it's obvious they don't have the big investment money that the Western s or the corporate owned midwest hills have   most of the chairlifts are positively antiquated, they use paper lift tickets, and most of the facilities show an advanced age.  But it all works, and they do have some nice recent investment where it really matters   in grooming equipment, and an express lift on their busiest slope.   prices may seem high   they charge a lot of fees above and beyond the official lift ticket price, putting two ""last tracks"" tickets at nearly $200   but it gets you probably halfway to the West experience at nowhere near half the price.

It seemed like a perfect day with the park not being full and weather decent. After we paid I found out there was a discount for students. Went to guest services to ask about it, Jennifer went on to tell me she couldn’t do it. I asked for a manager and she proceeded to tell me that there wasn’t any manager on duty that could do the refund, and said she didn’t know when one would come. Found that extremely hard to believe considering the size alone of the place not to mention the amount of guests and employees that were there. When I asked if the manger would Be there later at night or in the morning so I could call she proceeded to tell me “the weather conditions could keep him/her from coming.”
re was barely a drizzle, no snow on the roads and no traffic. What conditions did she refer to ? 
When I called customer service I was told by the person on the phone that the information given to me by Jenifer was wrong and she apologized and was willing to help me right then and there but unfortunately I did not have my purchase order #. When I went back and mentioned what I was told all of a sudden there was someone there on duty who knew how to do the refund. If it was a busy day, I’d understand, you gotta take care of everyone, but there were zero people behind me on line when I asked about the student discount. 
All in all, this place wasn’t anything special from any other skiing  and the customer service alone will keep me from coming back. I’m it’s not cheap. Rental and lift ticket is $140 alone. Not to mention the ridiculously over priced and horrible quality food that is offered. Burger was given to me with a flat out hard bun and pizza was visibly dry and old. All in all we spent over $1500 in our stay between food and lift tickets for 8 people in the span of 5 hours and we were all extremely disappointed with the experience. Ensure your employees are either properly trained to handle every day situations, or at the very least, provide pleasant service. Hopefully, with a manager on duty every shift. ",Ski Bum
17959,2020-03-02,Wisconsin,Devils Head,5,Charged full price even though a quarter of the runs weren't even open. Been going there for over 30 years. More then likely never going back. Chestnut is closer.,Jay Larmee

18003,2020-03-08,Colorado,Vail,5,  You would think that Vail ski  could handle snow and be open for it. Spent two days there with horrible lines and most of the mountain closed due to snow. Really an expensive bad experience.,rlhinvail
18005,2020-03-09,California,Heavenly Mountain,5,"Skied the first week of December and last week of December.   Great conditions. 
My only complaint is how bad the gondola lines are at peak times and the operators fail to maximize the capacity by requiring 8 people per car.  ",David undefined
18029,2020-03-11,Minnesota,Lutsen Mountains,3,"Many workers on the lifts did not know how to get to trails or what lift to use to get there.  Trails are not marked well enough time to turn and end up in big trouble.  Lifts not marked on the levels available at the top, could be more trouble.   Also, for a beginner total Terror and  fear!!!!  Totally NOT the best place for a beginner.   Save your money for any beginner, and go someone where more comfortable to learn.  I have been working with my fiance for the last couple years at different ski mountains.  She was doing well, until she skied HERE.  On THE ""EASY"" hills.   Very steep and not a tapered gradual decline to practice form.   Overall, scared the ""HELL"" out of her.   Myself, I enjoyed skiing here, have been skiing for years. On net postings also.

18030,2020-03-11,Minnesota,Lutsen Mountains,3,"I moved to Minnesota after more than a decade skiing Big Sky Montana 70+ days a season, and more importantly, skiing the peak, out of bounds, the headwaters and in the trees. To say I had low hopes would be an understatement. A previous day skiing another prominent minnesota ski area was so underwhelming I left after my 4 run.

 first day I hit Lutsen I brought a friend from Big Sky.  easiest way for me to explain the day is this:
We were first in line at the gondola. We stopped one time at my truck to eat a few power bars. We stopped when the liftie said it was our last ride up. Apparently they were having an above average snow year. All I know is we found an almost endless supply of untouched  powder in different spots on 3 of the 4 mountains we skied. Right under the gondola top shack is a pruned out tree run that even has a few hidden ‘keyholes’ that lead to hidden meadows complete with small mandatory drops. We found cliffs hidden in the woods. Carved turns down Moose mountain at almost 65mph. We billy goated our way onto a rock garden and dropped a few pillow lines. Ya.... for being in the Midwest, Lutsen is not only legit, it legitly huge. I’ve skied s out west that are half the size of Lutsen. Anyone giving this place less than 5 stars isn’t a real skier. It’s one of two 5 star ski areas in the Midwest. Mt Bohemia is the other. On a powder day, I’ll take Lutsen over Mt Bohemia any day of the week. While Mt Bohemia has bigger cliffs, and a few areas of steepish trees... Lutsen offers everything, including hands down the steepest groomed runs I’ve ever seen. So steep the cats have to tie off and use a winch. I can’t wait to ski here again after they almost double the size of it through their future expansion plan. 
Ye ha! ",Joseph  Nauber
18039,2020-03-14,California,Mammoth Mountain,3,"I've been skiing Mammoth since the early '80's, and while the mountain itself is still awesome, the recent developments are not very promising. I was appalled at how many low ratings recent reviews are showing, and it's pretty clear why: KSL/Alterra has in a short time destroyed what Mammoth has been about since Dave McCoy built it, all in the name of corporate profit. y'd better get their heads out of their collective arses and understand two things: 

1) Mammoth is not, and never will be, a ""destination "" like Aspen; it lacks the infrastructure and space to support such development (just ask Starwood and IntraWest how well it worked out for them).
2) Ask almost anyone who's been coming to or lives in Mammoth about it, and (aside from some business interests) almost all of them will tell you they don't WANT it to become such a place and lose the unique vibe that is Mammoth Lakes.

Mr. McCoy used to take care of the locals, with ""homeboy rates"" for passes, etc., as well as senior passes at an affordable price; that's all gone now, and in place of affordable passes we have the Ikon pass that gives access to a bunch of other s that most denizens of Mammoth have no use for. If we didn't happen to own a place in Mammoth, we'd likely stop coming. As it is now, I wonder how much longer I can afford to continue skiing this mountain.",gayendarren

18076,2020-03-20,Idaho,Lookout Pass,1,"Lookout is the best  in the area imo. It's almost always got great snow and tree skiing, it's affordable, there are no lift lines, and everyone's just happy to be out there   it's a great atmosphere. It's the best if you don't need the big  frills and just want to get to what you're there to do   ski. Couldn't recommend Lookout enough.",Linda Smith
18106,2020-04-15,California,Mammoth Mountain,3,"So now the latest: With the mountain closed since early March, those of us who've spent hundreds of dollars on season (""IKON"") passes obviously have not been able to utilize them. Understandable and the necessary thing. 

However, is Alterra doing anything to ease that loss for its customers? Oh yeah    I just got the email offering us an additional $50 discount on our renewals for next season. REALLY? That's almost an insult. How about 50% OFF? We all bought a ""product"" that we can't use because the product is not available (I've gotten in ONE day on the mountain this season); now they want us to buy it again, throwing us this $50 bone...

Time for us to Mammoth ites start a movement and let Alterra/KSL know that there's more to mountain life than corporate profit. #WHATWOULDDAVEDO",gayendarren

18110,2020-04-23,Washington,Stevens Pass,1,"Been skiing here for 20 years, but may be the last.  Absolutely terrible grooming compared to a few years ago.   With all the snow that they get at Stevens they should be able to buff that mountain out.  Maybe they need to hire Mission Ridges’ crew.  I’ve seen people get launched off the ruts on what appear to be groomed runs.  This year it is particularly bad.  On some wider runs they basically make a cat track from top to bottom.  ",Matt  H
18122,2020-08-30,Idaho,Schweitzer,3,"I grew up skiing this mountain. y have made nice improvements since then on the backside.  high speed quads are nice. Unfortunately they completely detreed an entire bowl on the backside, which must have sounded like a good idea at the time, but actually caused it to heat under the sun and refreeze as crud most days. Sadly, last year they cut our season on March 10. It was an awesome March with several good snow showers. We could have easily skied til late April. I called this year to see if they were going to make good for pass holders this year with some sort of discount. Instead they actually raised the prices by 50 bucks. Classic Vail Resorts move.",Dave Morrison
18123,2020-08-30,Idaho,Schweitzer,3,"Schweitzer Sucks. Skied back to back w/ Silver, Lookout,& 49 and they were = or better factoring price.

18142,2020-10-22,Utah,Beaver Mountain,5,"Beaver Mountain is an awesome family run ski  in northern Utah.   ski  is on a northern aspect, which means that the snow stays pristine until the temperatures warm up in spring.  Saturday is the only day you really have to watch out for others, and if you come midweek you will almost feel like you have the entire mountain to yourself.  re are plenty of options for different skill levels and the trails are well networked.   biggest downside for me is that the mountain is normally only open 9 4. y do offer night skiing for an additional cost on some nights.  But overall, amazing snow, great place, and also super cheap. ",Payton Sharum
18144,2020-10-22,Wyoming,Snowy Range,5,"I love how cozy this ski area is. Sure, it doesn't have the gnarliest terrain, but if you're looking for a cheap ski day with reliable snow conditions, this is the place to be! I also like the vibe of not having any cell service on any of the mountain. It almost feels like this  is still living in the past. All four of the chairlifts are classic two or three seaters (not express). 

Even days after a recent storm, I'm able to find fresh snow in the trees. Ski the trees.",Payton Sharum

18168,2020-11-12,Utah,Solitude Mountain,5," value of Solitude has tanked tremendously with the crowds coming on the ikon pass, parking fees, no decent liftopia deals, elevated snow sports school pricing, and raised age of ""Free to ski"" (used to be 6 and under).  Last season, the were still friendly folk.  Brighton has the same snow and much more to offer in terms of terrain, snow school instruction, ""free to ski"" (10 and under) and ticket pricing.  See no reason to come to Solitude as there's not any solitude...",Steven Freund
18198,2020-12-03,Washington,Mt. Baker,5,"First time to Baker after a snowy Nov.  Parking still good at 8:45am. Roads plowed and sanded perfectly.  Covid precautions in effect, but everyone was cool about it. Blue Bird Powder Day, amazing conditions.  Grooming great for those who need that.  
Tickets are $67 for an adult full day at the window.  No corporate passholder gimmicks, no price fixing, No VAIL or ALTERRA. Can't say how much I appreciate the owners of this operation fighting off these greed vultures.
This mountain is best suited for Intermediate to Advanced Skiers/Boarders. Not really a place for Noobs and Suburbanite Family Gapers.  Cell reception is great now.  re is no terrain park that I could find.  You need a beacon and gear for upper backcountry areas.  Loved the challenging canyons and wide open powder areas. I will drive the extra distance to shred this mountain over the formerly known mountain of Stevens Pass anytime.
