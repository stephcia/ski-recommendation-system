5/4/23,Vermont,Stratton,3,"A good mountain. The terrain was nothing expert-level, in comparison to other East Coast mountains. The gondola was pretty slow, and the organization of lifts was not my favorite. It was a nice early season mountain, but being in Southern VT, it's snowpack did not last as long as competitors.

5/9/23,Colorado,Breckenridge,3,Huge mountain but not as pretty. Blues are too easy. Great local village though and fun apres. Very crowded greens ,Deanna Uzarski

5/9/23,Colorado,Vail,4,One of my favorites. Good intermediate terrain and fun back bowls. less steep overall. A little fancy / kinda snobby ,Deanna Uzarski
5/10/23,Colorado,Breckenridge ,4,"Breck is a decent resort, but a lot of the terrain is pretty uninteresting. Blues are very flat for example. Some of this was also due to me being with a beginner crew, and it’s a bit harder to just ski an advanced run next to a beginner run here. Also it can be crowded and is a pain to get between peaks. That being said, there’s a lot of variety for everyone, a lot of things to do in town, and lodging isn’t super expensive. Also the T Bar bar is very fun for Apres. ",Raghava Kamalesh
5/10/23,Colorado,Crested Butte,5,"Really amazing and extensive terrain for advanced and expert skiers. Also great transit between town and resort, and the town has amazing food and bars. Had no idea how nice and kind of fancy of a resort Crested Butte is. Intermediates could start to exhaust their options after a couple days, but what does exist for them is great. ",Raghava Kamalesh
5/10/23,Colorado,Vail,5,"I enjoyed Vail a lot more this time than my last time. I finally made it to Blue Sky Basin which really is an amazing area that one could spend a lot of time at. Also I really like the parking garage situation, despite being a little pricey there are no bad parking spots because the garage is vertical and you can get to the lifts quickly. There are some fun long frontside runs as well that have enough of an angle to have fun ripping even if they aren’t challenging. When the snow is good, there’s just a lot of terrain at Vail that’s very fun and the quantity of it means it stays good for a bit even tho the resort is still crowded. ",Raghava Kamalesh
5/10/23,Colorado,Beaver Creek,3,"There are some good runs here, and part of my qualms are just being unfamiliar with the resort, but it’s easy to not know where you’re going. We found ourselves on a ton of cat tracks or very flat crossing areas. Getting around felt like a very conscious decision vs just being able to ski fun runs to the other side. Also getting parking at the main area is tough and the bus ride from the bottom parking lot, while not bad, is still not as convenient as transit as other resorts. ",Raghava Kamalesh
5/10/23,Colorado,Telluride,5,"Telluride is amazing. The town has very good food and cool bars, the gondola transportation is great, and the lodging options are awesome. Staying in town vs mountain village can give two cool and different options. The scenery is the best in the US and the terrain has a lot of varied options to challenge people. Having double greens and double blues is helpful since the resort is steep and this makes it easier for intermediates to progress. And there are endless crazy lines to ski if you’re willing to hike a little. Only downsides are harder to get to and expensive. ",Raghava Kamalesh
