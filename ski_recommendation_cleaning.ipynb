    "Skiing offers a unique blend of adventure, physical activity, and natural beauty, making it a popular choice for winter enthusiasts seeking both relaxation and excitement.\n",

    "The ski market in the United States is thriving, contributing significantly to the economy. According to the [National Ski Areas Association (NSAA)'s](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://nsaa.org/webdocs/Media_Public/IndustryStats/Historical_Skier_Days_1979_2022.pdf) 2022 annual report, approximately 60.7 million skiers and snowboarders visited 473 ski resorts in the 2021-2022 winter season."

    "Skiing is an exhilarating winter activity enjoyed by many, but barriers such as high costs and limited accessibility often hinder people from fully experiencing its joys. Choosing the right ski resort can be overwhelming due to the multitude of options available, and existing websites lack dynamic filtering capabilities based on user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, I'm developing Avant Ski, a ski resort recommendation app. Avant Ski simplifies the ski resort selection process by leveraging data and user preferences. With dynamic filtering features, users can personalize their search based on budget, location, amenities, and skill level. By bridging the gap between ski enthusiasts and their dream destinations, Avant Ski makes skiing accessible to a wider audience, empowering them to plan unforgettable ski trips with confidence."
