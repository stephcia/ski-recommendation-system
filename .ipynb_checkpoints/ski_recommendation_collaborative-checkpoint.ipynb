    "Skiing holds a prominent place for those seeking winter recreational activities in the United States. With its stunning mountain ranges and diverse terrain, the country boasts numerous ski resorts that cater to all skill levels, from beginners to seasoned professionals. Skiing offers a unique blend of adventure, physical activity, and natural beauty, making it a popular choice for winter enthusiasts seeking both relaxation and excitement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ski market in the United States is thriving, contributing significantly to the economy. According to the [National Ski Areas Association (NSAA)](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://nsaa.org/webdocs/Media_Public/IndustryStats/Historical_Skier_Days_1979_2022.pdf), approximately 60.7 million skiers and snowboarders visited 473 ski resorts in the 2021-2022 winter season."

    "Skiing is an exhilarating winter activity enjoyed by many, but barriers such as high costs and limited accessibility often hinder people from fully experiencing its joys. Choosing the right ski resort can be overwhelming due to the multitude of options available, and existing websites lack dynamic filtering capabilities based on user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, I'm developing Avant Ski, a ski resort recommendation app. Avant Ski simplifies the ski resort selection process by leveraging data and user preferences. With dynamic filtering features, users can personalize their search based on budget, location, amenities, and skill level. By bridging the gap between ski enthusiasts and their dream destinations, Avant Ski makes skiing accessible to a wider audience, empowering them to plan unforgettable ski trips with confidence."

    "# Data Modeling - Recommendation System\n",
    "The proposed recommendation system will adopt a cascade hybrid approach, integrating user-based filtering and content-based recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **cascade hybrid** approach establishes a hierarchical structure within the recommendation system. The primary model, a collaborative user-based system, will generate the initial set of recommendations based on user preferences and ratings. Then, a secondary model, a content-based system, will refine the recommendations by considering additional factors such as mountain characteristics and user-defined filters. This two-step process aims to provide more accurate and personalized ski resort suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **user-based collaborative** filtering phase, the model will analyze the historical ratings of users for different ski resorts. By identifying users with similar rating patterns, the model will predict the target user's ratings for unvisited resorts, leveraging the collective wisdom of similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **content-based system** operates by constructing a matrix of resort features and determining the similarity between resorts based on these features. This approach allows the system to identify resorts with similar characteristics and recommend them based on user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the accuracy of the collaborative model, the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** score will be used. This metric quantifies the difference between the actual ratings and the predicted ratings, providing insights into the model's performance in capturing user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the content-based system does not have an accuracy score, a combination of ski expertise and specific user information will be utilized to subjectively assess the effectiveness of the hybrid model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing both user-based and content-based approaches, the cascade hybrid recommendation system aims to enhance the ski resort selection process, **offering users more personalized and relevant recommendations**."
